LA LA LAND Written by Damien Chazelle FADE IN... A sun-blasted sky. We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... We're -- 1 EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY Cars are at a standstill. It's a horrific traffic jam. Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the distance. We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after another... One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO, until finally we begin to hear... ...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN] We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing. The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on her radio -- then starts SINGING. Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL- FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER... Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts. We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars, taking the magic in... Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles -- and the song comes to a dramatic stop. Flash title card: WINTER A1 We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". But he keeps stopping it, over and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot. Revision 2. B1 OMIT C1 We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. A light-green 2005 Prius. Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. Six years of "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer. She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. Fast, fiery, full of energy -- MIA ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity. Mia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... Then leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger seat. It's a SCRIPT. MIA (CONT'D) (reading now) Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. She's too focused on her lines to notice. Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. Mia comes to. Jerked back to reality. The honking car behind her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him the finger. We then FOLLOW her as she drives... 2 OMIT 3 OMIT 4 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as -- CUSTOMER #1 This doesn't taste like almond milk. MIA Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it -- CUSTOMER #1 Can I see the carton? Mia hands it over. The Customer looks. CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D) I'll have a black coffee. Mia gets the coffee. Quickly sneaks a look at a script hidden underneath her counter. The same one we saw in her car... Revision 3. She hands the coffee to the Customer. We follow the Customer out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. We don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the shop turn immediately to her. We see one CUSTOMER whisper to another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by... WOMAN Cappuccino, please. Mia nods. Gets it made. The Manager takes it from her. MANAGER On us. WOMAN No, I insist. She pays. Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar. Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away... Then -- Mia's phone rings. It reads: "MOM". Mia presses "IGNORE" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07. MIA Shit. Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as -- MANAGER Where do you think you're going? MIA It's -- five past... MANAGER You'd better be here early tomorrow. MIA Ok. -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. Coffee and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're -- 5 INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. On her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges -- MIA (CONT'D) And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... Revision 4. Her nerves are practically visible. As she talks, we PULL BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR. MIA (CONT'D) No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? (as her smile contracts) Oh. I see... (silence; she clenches her jaw...) No, you're right. I understand. (...and a tear falls from her eye) Ok... I just... Oh... An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. Can I come in? MIA (CONT'D) (crying now) No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just -- CASTING DIRECTOR One second. Mia stops. The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. The Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. Mia stands there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks. CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) ...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost done in here. The Assistant nods. Walks out. Mia waits, trying to maintain... CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) You know what? I think we're good. Thanks for coming in. Mia looks at her. A beat. 6 INT. LOBBY - DAY Mia exits. Nerves still on edge. Passes one beautiful redhead after the next -- all getting ready to cry. Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque. Also redheads. 7 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING Mia enters. Exhausted. Heads to her ROOM. Revision 5. Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid Bergman one over the bed. There's also a shelf filled with acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. Various other trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. Mia takes off her shoe. A blister on her sole. 8 WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a towel. She hums to herself. The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the lights. Looks... With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes her hair... Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken. TRACY Holy Mother of God. Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27. TRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? MIA I wanted to give you an entrance. ALEXIS (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? MIA Eh... ALEXIS Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel? MIA I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. ALEXIS They're the worst. MIA I don't know if they were there. As Mia slips away -- ALEXIS I bet they were. Revision 6. CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? TRACY Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom -- MIA Can't. Working. TRACY (O.S.) What? (we PAN BACK to Tracy) Did she say "working"? A8 We follow Mia INSIDE her room. She closes the door. Takes a moment. You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on the town is the last thing she wants to do now. B8 WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door. MIA (opening up) Yes? TRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming. C8 With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet -- TRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. MIA It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. TRACY Exactly. Fun. She pulls out a blue dress. As Alexis hurries in -- TRACY (CONT'D) MIA This looks familiar. I was going to give it back! Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as she grabs it -- Revision 7. ALEXIS Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood cliché crammed into a single home? TRACY (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest. Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that -- Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD] She play-acts the clichés this party will represent. Alexis and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. Mia can't help but laugh. The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia to join the night's revelry... Mia remains reluctant. Stays behind in her room as her roommates head out the door. But she's starting to wonder: A night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out with her friends...? 9 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET - NIGHT We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin, marching across the courtyard and toward the street. They sing, dance, half-assuming Mia is a no-go -- -- until Mia APPEARS, blue-dress-clad. Her roommates look at her in surprise -- then delight. The energy swells and the four characters dance their way together down the street. They dive into a single CAR, and WE DISSOLVE TO... 10 OMIT. A10 OMIT. 11 EXT. CITY - NIGHT An old-fashioned MONTAGE of a night on the town: neon signs and overflowing champagne glasses. Soon enough, we're at... 12 EXT. MODERN HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT Valet cars lined up. We FOLLOW Alexis, Tracy, Caitlin and Mia to the door... 13 INT./EXT. HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT ...and into a big-glass hilltop pad. We FOLLOW Mia as she takes in her surroundings. Revision 8. A D.J. turning tables. A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in rhythm by the bar. Yep -- every cliché is here... Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch her. Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her. She makes a hasty exit toward the bar -- but the line's obscenely long. She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way, making out. She slips in behind them... A13 Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. The joy of seconds ago is gone from her eyes now. She gazes into the mirror -- -- and SINGS by herself. This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less brash, and far more vulnerable... Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the crowd... B13 We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the pain underneath the clichés... Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE SNOW falling from above... As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps -- -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL. This is the climax of the number. Everyone joins in, circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky. Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes with a blast of fireworks. C13 OMIT A14 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Close on a sign: "NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE". Revision 9. MIA (O.S.) No... We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. No car in sight. She reaches into her purse, pulls out her cell phone to call Tracy. It's dead. MIA (CONT'D) No... 15 OMIT 16 OMIT 17 OMIT A17 OMIT B17 OMIT 18 OMIT 19 EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. She crosses roads and lots, navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to shrubbery. A19 And then -- she hears something... Music. A piano, in the distance. And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well... Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several doors. Then stops. Has found where it's coming from... She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door... AND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO: 20 EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began with. This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker. He passes Mia's car. She gives him the finger. He drives on, shaking his head... 21 OMIT 22 EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at a 30's Deco building. A sign above the door: "VAN BEEK". A newer sub-heading below: "TAPAS & TUNES". Revision 10. The door opens. Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet stand. Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. The employees notice him. Recognize him. What is it with that guy...? 23A OMIT 23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around. SEBASTIAN You gotta stop breaking into my home. She looks up. She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister. LAURA You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool -- SEBASTIAN Please don't sit on that. LAURA Are you serious? SEBASTIAN Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. LAURA I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. It's a throw rug. SEBASTIAN Don't need it. LAURA Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? SEBASTIAN That's almost insulting... (then,) Did he? Revision 11. She shakes her head: Unbelievable. Tosses the rug to the side. LAURA When are you going to unpack these boxes? SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. LAURA Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. (then, looks at him --) You're not still going by there, are you? SEBASTIAN No. A beat. Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. You believe that? LAURA Seb -- SEBASTIAN Who wants to tapas while they samba? LAURA I have someone I want you to meet. SEBASTIAN I don't want to meet anyone. LAURA You'll like her. SEBASTIAN Uh-huh. Does she like jazz? LAURA Probably not. SEBASTIAN Then what are we gonna talk about? LAURA You'll talk about the weather. SEBASTIAN Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. Revision 12. LAURA Sebastian -- SEBASTIAN How long's it been? LAURA You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You're driving without insurance. SEBASTIAN I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. LAURA You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off. SEBASTIAN What's the difference? LAURA It's not as romantic as that. (she starts to walk off) And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you. SEBASTIAN Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word? LAURA Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her. She heads to the door. He follows her, won't give it up -- SEBASTIAN You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope. Laura can't help but laugh. Stops by the door. Looks at him. LAURA I love you. Unpack your boxes. SEBASTIAN I'm changing the locks. Revision 13. LAURA (out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it. She's gone. Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out -- SEBASTIAN I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! No reply to his triumphant declaration. He shuts the door. Looks again at the napkin. Thinks. Tosses it in the trash. A23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Moments later. Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano. "Japanese Folk Song" -- the piece we heard in his car -- plays... Sebastian plays along. Stops. Moves the record back a few bars. Starts it again. Plays the same passage over. Stops. Moves the record back a second time. Plays the passage again. Stops. Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally, he gets it right. He keeps playing, louder now, and we're -- B23 OMIT 24 OMIT 25 OMIT 26 OMIT 27 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. Christmas decorations all over. Sebastian steps in. Immediately beelining over -- BOSS Seb. SEBASTIAN (putting on a smile) Bill. Thanks for having me back. BOSS Your welcome. Stick to the set list. Revision 14. SEBASTIAN Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. SEBASTIAN How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? (the Boss just glares) Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal. Sebastian sits down at the keys. A WAITRESS passes by. WAITRESS Well... Welcome back. SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. With that -- he starts playing "Jingle Bells". 28 INT. RESTAURANT - LATER The restaurant's demographic has changed. It's now younger stragglers wandering in. Sebastian looks beyond bored. He finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". Zero applause. He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". But something seems to come over him now. He's restless. Slowly, his playing drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path... And then -- we hear a melody. The one Mia heard outside. The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song... The door opens -- and Mia steps in. She sees Sebastian at the piano. Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND SEBASTIAN'S THEME] Gradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. We drift away from reality. Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... He concludes his piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz now, as we pull back to real life... ...and see the Boss looking on in scorn. Revision 15. Sebastian finishes. Silence. Mia looks like the wind has been knocked out of her. Sebastian looks up for a second -- and sees her. They look at one another. Just a moment. Then -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. WE STAY ON Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. We just see the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. Then, we get closer -- and realize: BOSS ...every goddamned night. Sebastian is silent. Then, doesn't want to have to beg but -- SEBASTIAN I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- BOSS Too late. You're done. SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. You know that. BOSS (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit? With that, the Boss walks off. We linger on Sebastian. Anger giving way -- to hurt. He starts hurrying toward the door. BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. She watches Sebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to lay it all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and -- MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but Sebastian just walks right by -- his shoulder bumping against Mia's for an added measure of disdain. He heads out the door. Slams it shut. Mia is left standing on her own. She looks like she's just been slapped. SMASH CUT TO BLACK. Revision 16. SPRING 29 OMIT 30 INT. AUDITION ROOMS - DAY Mia auditions. Pilot season cattle-call -- a series of soul- crushing try-outs. She's pandering to the hilt. Quick glimpses: MIA (CONT'D) I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. Did you test for achromatopsia? 31 Then, a second audition -- MIA (CONT'D) D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights. 32 And finally, a third audition -- MIA (CONT'D) This is my classroom. You don't like it, the door's to my left. READER (O.S.) (a well-dressed forty-year-old WOMAN reading from sides) Lady why you be trippin' like that? MIA No, Jamal. You be trippin'. 34 EXT. PARTY - DAY Mia wanders around another party. A BAD 80's COVER BAND plays. TRACY There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer. CARLO TRACY Nice to meet you, Mia. He's got projects all over town. CARLO (shrugs, faux-modest) They say I have a knack for world-building. MIA (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. I have to grab a drink... Revision 17. She slips away. Presses toward the bar. The music gets louder, more obnoxious. She peers toward the band to get a look... And then she sees him. Sebastian. Playing keyboard-guitar for the band. Dressed up like his band- mates in a bright polyester outfit. And hating every second. The band finishes, and the SINGER addresses the (thin) crowd. SINGER Alright, one more for y'all before we break. Do I hear any requests? MIA "I Ran". Sebastian turns. Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin, enjoying her power. He thinks -- then recognizes the face. SINGER "I Ran" it is. (to Sebastian) Wanna start us off, piano-man? Sebastian stays silent. Mortified. Finally, so reluctant, he taps his keyboard to count the band in and begins playing. On the keys, it's a single note, repeated measure after measure. Mia knew this. Sebastian looks at her. She smiles right back. SINGER (CONT'D) I walked along the avenue... 35 EXT. PARTY / INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Set break. Sebastian hurries from the keys -- enters the house, looks both ways, finally spots Mia and -- SEBASTIAN Ok. I remember you. Mia looks at him. One eyebrow raised. Yeah? SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And I'm sorry if I was curt that night. MIA "Curt"? SEBASTIAN Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision 18. MIA Ok. SEBASTIAN But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far. MIA My God. Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? SEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. MIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? SEBASTIAN Why? MIA Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. SEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything? MIA Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic. SEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. SINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. Second set. Sebastian looks at Mia. She smirks. Pleased. The Singer walks off. SEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. MIA He just told you what to do. SEBASTIAN I let him. Revision 19. A beat. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? MIA Mia. SEBASTIAN Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies. He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes: SINGER Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... 36 EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT The party's finished. Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys, as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in the back, waiting, is Mia. She's stuck once again with CARLO, who's regaling her -- CARLO ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys. CARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. For the bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a franchise. But the thing is it's grounded. MIA (to Sebastian) George Michael! Sebastian stops. Looks at her. Surprised. SEBASTIAN You again. MIA Did you just get your keys? Sebastian thinks. Sees the Valet. Playing it off -- SEBASTIAN ...Yeah. Revision 20. MIA Can you grab mine? SEBASTIAN ...Which one is it? MIA The Prius. A beat. Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. Motions to the Valet: Sorry. One second. Looks. All the keys are Prius keys. MIA (CONT'D) The one with the green ribbon. Another beat. Sebastian finds it. Grabs it. 37 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Mia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. Mia aims her key fob. No beep. Sebastian points his own keys, also aiming for a beep. Silence. They've been at this for a while. MIA (CONT'D) (almost tripping in her heels) Shit... SEBASTIAN Those look comfortable. MIA They are...n't. A beat. She aims again. No beep. MIA (CONT'D) Thank you for saving the day back there. SEBASTIAN You didn't give me much of a choice. MIA Strange that we keep running into each other. SEBASTIAN It is strange. Maybe it means something. MIA I doubt it. SEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. Revision 21. On that, Mia aims again. As always -- no beep. Noticing -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Put the clicker under your chin. MIA What? Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. He looks idiotic. SEBASTIAN It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. MIA Uh-huh. SEBASTIAN You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. MIA Oh my God. Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINE APPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as you can see. It's the most romantic sight imaginable. They look at each other. A beat. And then -- MIA (CONT'D) Eh. They walk on, the lights shimmering behind. SEBASTIAN Not much to look at. MIA Agreed. I've seen better. And on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT] Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of this setting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alone together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. It's "no big deal", nothing they haven't seen or felt before -- because, after all, there's no chance for romance between them... Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggests otherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes for flats in her handbag. Sebastian sits beside her as she slips the flats on. They look at each other, suspicious... Revision 22. He moves his foot. She moves hers. They look at each other again. Still suspicious... He moves again. She moves again. They seem to be moving in sync -- without their even wanting to... And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost slipped into DANCE... Sebastian rises. Mia rises as well. The two look at each other. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights stretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- share a look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW... Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Mia shakes her head: "Nope". They make the road their own, growing more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find -- ...that they can really dance together. Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer and closer, looking at each other almost giddily... ...a sound cuts through. It's a CELL PHONE ring. Mia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench. Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell. MIA (CONT'D) Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon... She hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. An awkward silence. Finally -- she presses her fob again. Puts it under her chin this time. A BEEP can be heard. They see her Prius. MIA (CONT'D) Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car? SEBASTIAN No, that's fine... Thanks... MIA ...Ok... Not sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. Waves. MIA (CONT'D) Night. Sebastian waves back. Mia drives off. Fast. Silence... Revision 23. Looking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be, Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down. A37 Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera -- right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. He pulls out his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all. 38 OMIT 39 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY CLOSE on -- CUSTOMER Are these pastries gluten-free? Mia's at work. A typically chaotic day. MIA No... CUSTOMER What?? I want a refund. Mia nods, heads to the Manager -- MANAGER You're closing up Friday. MIA I have an audition. Remember? MANAGER Do I look like I care? Reschedule it. MIA But you said -- MANAGER And fix your apron. With that, the Manager walks off. Mia is silent for a moment -- wants to talk back but needs this job -- then turns -- and sees Sebastian at the counter. MIA ...Hi. (then) What are you doing here? SEBASTIAN Meetings. Studio heads. Revision 24. MIA Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot? SEBASTIAN Piece of cake. Mia looks at him. He's sweating through his shirt. A beat. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. You got a break coming up? Mia laughs. A moment. MIA I'm off in ten. SEBASTIAN Great. I'll hide in the bathroom. 40 EXT. COFFEE SHOP / STUDIO LOT - DAY Mia exits, apron off. She and Sebastian start walking. She points across the street -- to the façade of a Parisian apartment. MIA That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca. Sebastian nods. They start walking. SEBASTIAN What's your Bogart's name...? (Mia looks at him) Is it Greg? MIA Yeah. Greg. SEBASTIAN How long have...? MIA We've been seeing each other for a few months. An awkward beat. They pass a wooden SALOON -- where a WESTERN is being shot. Extras in COWBOY costumes drink coffee on the steps. Revision 25. MIA (CONT'D) I love this stuff. Makes coming to work easier. SEBASTIAN I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club. MIA Oh yeah? SEBASTIAN It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. (then,) It's a samba-tapas place now. MIA A what? SEBASTIAN Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history. Mia laughs. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing. They reach a patch of green. Another shoot. A P.A. yells out: P.A. Clear the frame! MIA (to Sebastian) We need to wait here. SEBASTIAN I know. They shoot movies on my street. "C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to sign out." Mia laughs. A beat. A.D. (O.S.) Quiet on set! Mia and Sebastian watch the cameras roll. Then, in a whisper -- SEBASTIAN How'd you get into all this? Revision 26. MIA Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. (a beat; then,) I never knew the world was so big. DIRECTOR (O.S.) Cut! Mia and Sebastian resume walking. Now, at full volume -- MIA I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year. SEBASTIAN Who would you invite to watch? Your parents? MIA God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying. C40 CUT TO: The entrance to a giant soundstage. MIA (CONT'D) Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things. She and Sebastian stop. Peer inside the stage. MIA (CONT'D) I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. (a beat; then, deadpan --) Should've been a lawyer. Revision 27. They resume walking. D40 CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the bright blue sky. SEBASTIAN ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers. MIA Well it doesn't need more actresses. SEBASTIAN You're not just an actress. MIA What do you mean, "just an actress"? SEBASTIAN You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright. MIA That is not what I said. SEBASTIAN You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are. MIA Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible. SEBASTIAN All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history. MIA Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. Sebastian laughs. MIA (CONT'D) Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you... SEBASTIAN Yeah? Revision 28. MIA I hate jazz. Sebastian stops. Turns to her. SEBASTIAN What does that mean? "I hate jazz"? MIA It means when I listen to it I don't like it. SEBASTIAN But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying "I hate animals". MIA I do hate some animals. SEBASTIAN Do you need to be anywhere right now? Mia looks at him. We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. And we're in -- 41 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - DAY -- an old-school JAZZ CLUB. It's almost empty, only aged JAZZ CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET... SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other. MIA I thought it was just Kenny G. SEBASTIAN ...What? Mia looks at him. Already knows just how to get to him. MIA I associate it with facials. It's relaxing. SEBASTIAN It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision 29. MIA (laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. SEBASTIAN Mia. These are things you can't unsay. She bursts into laughter. Sebastian points to the band -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once. A beat. Mia looks at the band. We DRIFT over the instruments... SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. This whole thing -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want. Mia looks at Sebastian. Her laughter has subsided. She can see something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of... MIA Your club? SEBASTIAN ...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect. He watches the band. Lost in the sound. Then -- sincere -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The world tells everyone to move on. Says the music's had its moment. But I love it too much. I'm not moving on. The band finishes. The ride cymbal sizzles in the air... SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) So? He looks at Mia. She's visibly moved. Just then -- we hear a BEEP. Mia looks at her phone. Revision 30. 42 INT. SIDE CORRIDOR - LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - CONTINUOUS MIA Hi, I just missed a call... 43 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - MOMENTS LATER Mia steps out, dazed. Sebastian's listening to a new tune. He spots Mia, turns to her -- as, shouting over the music -- MIA (CONT'D) I got a call-back! SEBASTIAN Really? For what? MIA That show I told you about. SEBASTIAN Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.? MIA Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause. SEBASTIAN That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!" Mia laughs. But Sebastian can tell something in her laugh... SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You've seen it, right? MIA Obviously. (a beat; then --) No. SEBASTIAN What? You're the movie person. MIA It's the one I lie about. SEBASTIAN Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research. MIA (considering this) ...Ok. Revision 31. SEBASTIAN 10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool? MIA Ok. (another nod, taking it in) For research. Mia looks at him -- he looks at her -- each of them suppressing a newfound giddiness... And on that -- 44 EXT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - EVENING Mia and Sebastian exit. Wave "good-bye". We FOLLOW Sebastian. He rounds the corner, nears the Hermosa Beach pier... ...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. The feeling that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love... He gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. Dances with an OLD COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a dream. There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure if this dream will sustain. But for now, it's a beautiful feeling... The MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT. 45 EXT. AUDITION BUILDING - DAY A Pasadena building. As Mia approaches the door, another cell ring. It's her MOM. This time, Mia is happy to get the call: MIA (CONT'D) Hi, Mom! MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Hi, sweetie. How are you? MIA Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oh my God! You're going to be on TV?? MIA Well -- it's not picked up yet. MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Not picked up? MIA First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision 32. MIA'S MOM (O.S.) And you're in the pilot? MIA Well, no, I have a call-back. MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week? MIA It's another audition. MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV... MIA ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. MIA'S MOM (O.S.) No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. What channel? ABC? HBO? MIA Oxygen. MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oxygen? MIA You know what, I have to go. I love you. She hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Enters the building. 46 INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia sits, starts reviewing her script. Looks around her -- the room is filled with ACTRESSES silently MOUTHING THEIR LINES. It's a bizarre sight: a dozen women moving their mouths, with no sound coming out at all. What's more, they're all in variations of the same type of costume: Michelle Pfeiffer's leather jacket from Dangerous Minds. A few stare at Mia, sizing her up. In the corner, another one of them GRUNTS while performing stretches. Then -- a DOOR to the side opens, and Mia can hear -- DIRECTOR (O.S.) ...We'll be seeing you very soon. Revision 33. An ACTRESS exits. Absolutely beaming. And then, a bored voice -- ASSISTANT Mia Dolan? 47 INT. AUDITION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia steps in. The pilot's DIRECTOR is seated at a table, looking in his folder at Mia's head-shot. He looks up at Mia. DIRECTOR Whenever you're ready. Mia breathes in. Heart pounding. Sweat percolating. Has been practicing this for days now. Fighting her nerves, she begins -- MIA Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied -- DIRECTOR Thanks. Mia is taken aback. MIA I can do it another way -- DIRECTOR No, thanks, that was great. We linger on Mia for a moment, and then -- 48 EXT. PARKING LOT / INT. MIA'S CAR - DAY Crestfallen, humiliated, Mia hurries to her car. Sees a voice- mail on her cell. Plays it -- MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the guide! So exciting! So will you be getting health insurance now? Mia switches her phone off and drives. Clenches her jaw. Turns left and sees a movie theater. The Rialto. Manages a smile. Something she can remain upbeat about... Revision 34. 49 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - DAY Mia in her room, sorting through outfits. Slips into jeans -- ALEXIS Mia? -- then spins around, startled. Alexis is at the door, eating Fritos. Has been crying. ALEXIS (CONT'D) (with difficulty) Greg's here... Mia looks at Alexis -- completely confused. Then -- Greg steps out behind Alexis. Waves to her. GREG Hey... I'm parked out front. But we should hurry, my brother just landed. Mia looks at him, still confused. Then remembers. GREG (CONT'D) Did you forget? MIA Shit. No. Yes. I'll change... GREG (smiles) It's ok. Mia closes her door -- turns -- and we see her face. She's crushed. She goes to call Sebastian -- then freezes. Remembers something else. She never got his number... We linger on her face, as, on his phone outside her door -- GREG (O.S.) (CONT'D) Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will be there in twenty. 50 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT Sebastian's playing a jam session. Excited, distracted. 10pm can't come quickly enough. 51 INT. JAR - NIGHT Mia, in a green dress, with Greg, his brother JOSH, and Josh's FIANCEE. The restaurant is posh, modern. Josh wears a Brooks Brothers suit: he seems better-off than his brother. Revision 35. JOSH That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like -- FIANCEE It's like being in a movie theater. JOSH It's better than going to a theater, really. You know theaters these days -- GREG Oh, sure -- JOSH -- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just -- (his phone buzzes) -- just so annoying, I mean you're trying to watch a movie -- one second -- (opens phone) Hello?... His Fiancée smiles, looks at Greg and Mia, proud. FIANCEE Probably work. JOSH Yeah, I'll have to call you back. (closes and pockets his phone) So, yeah, we love it. Awkward silence. Mia hasn't spoken a word. 52 EXT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian paces. People shuffle in. He looks. No sign of Mia. 53 INT. JAR - NIGHT Midway through the meal. Mia is bored, restless, uneasy. JOSH (CONT'D) One word for you. Nicaragua. GREG I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing? Revision 36. JOSH Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable. Mia stays quiet, in her own thoughts, the voices around her fading away. And then she hears it -- coming from the restaurant speakers, peeking out subtly at first: the melody we now know so well... Her and Sebastian's song. She FREEZES. The radio music seems to have morphed into the melody, and the tune stirs something deep within her... A few seconds pass. And then she can't deny it any longer. It's clear as day to her now. She rises from her seat -- GREG Mia? -- looks at Greg -- MIA I'm sorry. -- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in -- -- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can. 54 EXT. JAR - NIGHT The MUSIC SWELLS, strings carrying us through and lifting Mia's spirits as she runs down the street in her green dress, for once absolutely sure of what she's doing... 55 INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT Inside the Rialto, Sebastian settling into his seat, the show about to begin. He's visibly disappointed that he's alone. The lights dim. Projector light cuts through the darkness. And then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle... He looks. The figure turns. Looks at him. It's Mia. And, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector light, her green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen behind her like a great piece of back-projection, she looks more beautiful than ever right now. A true old-fashioned screen siren. Sebastian's eyes go wide. He's surprised. And thrilled. He waves. Mia hurries toward him. Takes the seat next to his, as Rebel Without a Cause begins... Revision 37. 56 INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - LATER Half an hour has passed. The movie plays, lights flickering on Mia and Sebastian's darkened faces. He puts his arm on the armrest, she moves hers nervously. He scoots to his right, she scoots back. She edges her elbow onto the armrest, he moves his arm. Inch by inch, their bodies grow closer. Hands approaching, breaths quickening, hearts pounding... ...until finally their hands touch... And then, suddenly -- just as James Dean and Natalie Wood arrive at Griffith Observatory, and Mia and Sebastian seem about to kiss -- -- burn marks streak their way across the image. The screen goes blank. Silence. The lights go on. Mia and Sebastian turn around. AUDIENCE MEMBERS start murmuring. Sebastian can barely believe his bad luck. But then Mia turns to him. Energized. MIA (CONT'D) I have an idea. 57 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT Sebastian's car, traveling up a winding road, stars glittering above it, the lights of Los Angeles glittering below it. The sky is a deep, painted blue. Music plays... [PLANETARIUM] The car is bending around the turns, making its way up to... A57 ...the real Griffith Observatory. There, our MUSIC crests. Our two characters get out of the car and wander, searching for an open entrance. They find one -- and sneak in... 58 INT. GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS They ascend a staircase. Make their way past the exhibits -- the Tesla coil shooting off electric bolts. They reach the pendulum, gaze up at the mural above it, look at one another. Circle the pendulum, and then -- so tenderly, so nervously... Revision 38. ...they begin to DANCE. This is a dance that fulfills all the promise in their earlier duet. They circle the floor, gently and gracefully. The music BUILDS, and they drift into... A58 ...the PLANETARIUM. It's darkened, empty. Mia removes her shoes, feels the soft carpet under her feet. Turns on the projector. The screen STARTS TO GLOW. She and Sebastian take in the sight -- the STARS and GALAXIES... Enchanted, they look at one another, the lights from the screen reflected on their faces. They approach, as though about to kiss... When -- -- Mia's shoes LIFT UP. Float toward the ceiling -- toward the star-filled screen. She and Sebastian trade looks. Realize. And then they too begin to FLOAT... ...RISING from the floor, nothing stopping them. SOARING past the views of comets and moons and nebulae. Eyes wide, their emotions seized, as they HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHT... And so unspools a gravity-free dance. Mia and Sebastian SPIN and TWIRL through the planetarium as though they themselves were in outer space, flying through the cosmos. The music carries them higher and higher, and their spirits likewise soar -- JOYOUS, EXUBERANT -- until, finally... ...the music SOFTENS. Mia and Sebastian drift back to the floor like feathers. They land on a pair of seats. There, once again seated like audience members at a movie, they turn and look into each other's eyes. The music picks back up for the big finish, as the lovers lean in and -- in true movie- movie old-Hollywood big-musical fashion -- -- LOCK LIPS. It's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of all the hope and yearning and terror and wonder of love's first blush. A swoon-worthy kiss, with the orchestra soaring and the camera swooping in to catch the embrace in all its glory. On this triumphant moment... ...we IRIS FADE OUT. Revision 39. 59 OMIT 60 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Mia's scribbling in a notebook. It's dialogue. We see character headings, scene headings. Seems to be some kind of a script... TRACY (O.S.) What's that? Mia turns. Tracy has wandered in -- pajamas, eating cereal. TRACY (CONT'D) Is that a script? MIA It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself. ALEXIS (O.S.) (chiming in from her bedroom) A play? You better give us roles! MIA Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... A beat -- and then -- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. HONKING outside the nearest window. It's a honk we recognize: TRACY ...Is that gonna happen every time? MIA (glowing) I think so. A60 OMIT 61 EXT. MIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Mia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his arms. They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been separated for years. Sebastian drives off -- when -- MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) It's one-way!! The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the opposite direction. Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks up laughing. A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on: Revision 40. SUMMER The MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES: 62 -- Mia and Sebastian ambling past weathered 30's bungalows in BUNKER HILL... 63 -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT- ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms... 65 -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the "TAPAS & TUNES" sign. Excitedly tries to deface it. Mia, aghast, pulls him back... 66 -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at the tiny forest... A66 -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss... 67 OMIT 64 -- The GRAND CENTRAL MARKET, where they grab food... 68 -- ANGEL'S FLIGHT at night, where they stumble and slip into a tipsy, love-soaked dance... 69 OMIT Interspersed throughout, WE SEE IMAGES OF LOS ANGELES: 1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old lamps and Art Deco hotels. It's a gorgeous city, and the music only makes it more gorgeous -- building and carrying us to... 70 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT A Lighthouse JAM SESSION. Sebastian's at the keys, having a blast. The place is again mostly empty, but Mia is dancing her heart out. She shoots looks at Sebastian. He laughs, plays out for her. The two of them are in their own world -- one of pure, unadulterated JOY... The song ends. Sebastian rises, joins Mia. They sit down as the band strikes up a new tune, and kiss. KEITH (O.S.) Sebastian? Mia and Sebastian look up, startled. A YOUNG MAN, 35, is standing next to them. Tall, fierce eyes. This is KEITH. SEBASTIAN Keith? Revision 41. KEITH Holy shit. Come here, man. Sebastian gets up. Gives him a hug. But Mia can sense an unease in Sebastian's eyes. It's a strained hug. SEBASTIAN This is Mia. Mia, Keith. (explaining to Mia) We used to play together. KEITH MIA Hey, Mia. Hey... Sebastian sits back down. Wants to end the conversation. KEITH So how've you been? SEBASTIAN Great. You? KEITH Keeping busy. Got a new combo. SEBASTIAN Good for you. KEITH ...Looking for keys. SEBASTIAN (after a beat) I'm good. KEITH You sure? It pays. Sebastian looks at Keith. A moment. SEBASTIAN I'm good. Keith almost smiles. Expected this. KEITH Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long. SEBASTIAN You bet. KEITH Nice meeting you, Mia. Revision 42. MIA Nice meeting you. Keith walks off. Mia and Sebastian look at each other. Then -- 71 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT CLOSE ON MIA. She looks anxious. CLOSE ON Sebastian. He looks head-over-heels in love. SEBASTIAN It's beautiful. MIA ...You're just saying that. SEBASTIAN No... I'm not. We PULL BACK -- and see a script on Mia's lap. She's just finished reading Sebastian her play. MIA I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic? SEBASTIAN That's the point. MIA But do you think people will like it? SEBASTIAN Fuck `em. MIA (laughs) You always say that. SEBASTIAN I truly believe it. MIA Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise. SEBASTIAN I'll be front-row. Mia looks at him. Smiles. It genuinely means the world to her. Then, a glow in her eyes, wants to reciprocate -- Revision 43. MIA I made something for you. She hops off the bed, fishes through a bag. Pulls out a drawing. SEBASTIAN What's that? MIA It could be the name design. On the door. SEBASTIAN Why does it say "Seb's"? MIA That's what you should name it. SEBASTIAN Never. MIA Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick". SEBASTIAN You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name "Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick". MIA No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. (he rolls his eyes) And it's time to start looking for other places. SEBASTIAN It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history. MIA Make your own history. Sebastian looks at her. Appreciates that line. A beat. Then -- SEBASTIAN Your play's incredible. Mia smiles. He approaches her, sits by her side. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision 44. MIA I'm doing that. They laugh. MIA (CONT'D) So who was that guy at the Lighthouse? SEBASTIAN ...Which guy? MIA The one who offered you a gig. SEBASTIAN You mean Keith? He's the worst. MIA Why was it weird between you two? SEBASTIAN It's always weird with him. MIA He did offer you a job. SEBASTIAN Right... MIA Are you going to call him? SEBASTIAN No. A beat. MIA Ok... A moment passes. They lie down, side by side. SEBASTIAN Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- (Mia rolls her eyes) -- and your play is going to be a triumph. She looks at him. He looks at her. A shared smile. And on that -- Revision 45. 72 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING The next morning. Sebastian is in bed. Hears snatches of Mia's voice -- she's on her phone in the other room: MIA (O.S.) ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No, I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... (then,) He's great... He's going to open his own jazz club. It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... He's figuring it out... Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately... Sebastian listens. Takes it in. MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's Dad? On Sebastian. He thinks... 73 INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY Sebastian enters. Keith's combo is assembled. It's a sign-up practice room in the West Valley. There's a drummer, electric bassist, and trumpeter: COLE, MALCOLM and TOM. They're more polished in their looks than Sebastian. Well-groomed beards, tighter jeans. KEITH Sebastian. Sebastian approaches. KEITH (CONT'D) Didn't know if I'd see you today. SEBASTIAN (a bit awkward) Well... Here I am. A moment. Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Where's the piano? Keith gestures -- to an electronic keyboard. Sebastian winces. Revision 46. KEITH Here's the deal. We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We're about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good? We see Sebastian's face. Taken aback. KEITH (CONT'D) Sebastian? SEBASTIAN Yeah, that...that... (beat) ...sounds good. A moment. Keith smiles. KEITH Let's play, see how it feels. He pulls out a guitar. Cole starts on drums. Keith joins in. Malcolm and Tom follow suit. Sebastian listens. It sounds like modern jazz -- electronic in feel, but still jazz... Sebastian approaches the keyboard. Joins -- slowly, one step at a time. Then begins playing out a bit more, his fingers starting to race. Malcolm gives Keith a look: "Damn". Keith gives Malcolm a look back: "I told you so." Bit by bit, Sebastian eases into the groove. This isn't so bad... Then -- Keith moves to a LAPTOP. Introduces a DRUM-MACHINE SAMPLE. Sebastian, into the music, is caught off-guard. Uneasy now. This isn't him... Keith plays a riff on his guitar. Tom echoes it on bass, then Malcolm on trumpet. Now it's Sebastian's turn. He hesitates. And then -- finally -- he plays the riff... It doesn't feel so bad. The guys build on the riff. Sebastian keeps up with them, trying to let go of his presuppositions. After all -- these guys can play... The music builds, the whole thing swelling and finally CARRYING US TO -- A73 LATER: Sebastian and Keith sit across from each other as the other players pack up. Sebastian looks pensive. Noticing -- Revision 47. KEITH (CONT'D) I know. It's different. Sebastian stays silent. Then, leaning in -- KEITH (CONT'D) But you say you want to save jazz. How are you going to save jazz if no one's listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people hadn't gotten tired of what they were listening to before. (then,) I mean, do you really think a bunch of ninety-year-olds in a basement is the future of the form? Traditionalists whined when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs. If traditionalists had their way, we'd still be playing Dixieland. Sebastian considers this. As much as he might make a play of resisting -- we can tell the words are getting to him... SEBASTIAN You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future. A moment. Then -- KEITH I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't as good as you. But you're a pain in the ass, man. Sebastian nods. Knows he can't argue with that. Another beat. KEITH (CONT'D) If it's not your thing, just let me know. I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. But if you want it -- the job's yours. Sebastian looks at Keith. A moment. He's really weighing this. And on that -- his look of uncertainty -- we're -- 74 OMIT 75 OMIT 76 OMIT 77 OMIT Revision 48. 77pt INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK The door opens. Mia enters. Takes a deep breath. Hears piano. Steps forward and sees Sebastian at his piano -- playing a melody we've heard before. [CITY OF STARS AS DUET] She smiles. Sebastian begins to SING. Mia sits down beside him and begins to SING as well. They share a duet -- simple, unaffected, hopeful -- the music just perhaps suggesting their uncertainty about what they might be about to do... As the vocals give way to instrumentation, we're -- A77 OMIT B77 OMIT C77 OMIT 78 INT. DINER - DAY Sebastian and Keith hunched over paperwork. Sebastian signs... A78 INT. COFFEE SHOP / STUDIO LOT - DAY Mia handing the Manager her apron. She's done with the job... 80 INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY The band rehearsing in their new PRACTICE SPACE. We see Sebastian play, see Keith sing this time... 79 INT. CAFE - DAY Mia hunched over her script, obsessively fine-tuning it... 81 OMIT 82 OMIT 83 INT. DESIGNER CLOTHING STORE - DAY Sebastian gets dressed up in a new suit... 84 INT. BLACK-BOX THEATER - DAY We follow Mia through a BLACK-BOX THEATER in North Hollywood. The space is small, simple -- but perfect. We see her haggle with the OWNER -- and then light up. They shake hands... 85 INT. GREEN ROOM - EVENING Sebastian and the band in a green room, waiting. Sebastian's wearing the new suit. Looking sharper... Revision 49. 86 INT. VINTAGE SHOP - DAY Mia looking for PROPS. Another wild assortment -- a TOP HAT, a CANE, a DIORAMA of London, rolled-up MAPS, an old GLOBE... 87 OMIT 88 INT. APARTMENT - DAY We MOVE IN on a laptop. On it a YOUTUBE video plays -- an interview with Sebastian, Keith and the rest of the band... 89 EXT. RIALTO - DAY Mia drives by the Rialto theater. It's now CLOSED... 90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Mia sits on the floor, penciling out drawings for her play. Costume and poster sketches scattered by her feet. She's tired. The clock on the wall reads: 10:54pm. A90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT Mia gets into bed. Checks her phone. Turns off the light. B90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAWN Sebastian enters the apartment. Checks his reflection in the mirror -- a new addition. The clock reads: 4:57am. C90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN Sebastian gets into bed, careful not to wake Mia. D90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING Mia crosses through to the kitchen to get herself breakfast, careful not to wake Sebastian. The clock: 7:02am. E90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING Sebastian in bed, fast asleep. And WE RETURN TO... F90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK ...Mia and Sebastian at the piano, before this latest journey began, finishing their song. The last lyrics resonating as they look into one another's eyes: SEBASTIAN MIA City of stars... You've never shined so brightly. Revision 50. On that -- this image of love, Sebastian playing out the final chords on his piano -- WE GO DARK. All sound fades out. And then, we hear -- -- a CROWD CHEERING. [START A FIRE] We see -- a white spotlight. It reveals Sebastian. We're -- 91 INT. THE ECHO - NIGHT Sebastian is on-stage. He's the only musician we can see. The floor beyond the stage is FILLED with people. Among them, we spot Mia -- beaming with pride. Sebastian sees her, smiles to her as he plays a piano intro. Mia grins right back, heart swelling... A SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating Keith. He SINGS. He has a beautiful voice. Mia bobs her head. It's just Keith and Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune... And then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and -- BOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A full- fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic track. Mia is taken aback. But she keeps bobbing her head -- as the crowd around her GOES CRAZY... Keith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth sounds. We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith and Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been transformed beyond recognition. Not a hint of jazz... Keith breaks into the CHORUS -- and a TRIO OF BACKUP SINGERS are revealed stage-left. The band surges into the song's bridge -- and BACKUP DANCERS appear stage-right, scantily- clad. And then -- the lights go NUTS. It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through the dark. The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists... Mia looks at Sebastian. He's not fighting any of this. He sees her. She smiles. But something is changing in her expression... She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits. She looks at the crowd around her -- their hollers growing more and more frenzied as Sebastian launches into a prolonged SOLO... Revision 51. Mia looks back at him, takes it all in: Is this really him...? As the mass of people swells and moves, Mia finds herself PUSHED TO THE SIDE, bit by bit, away from the center... She tries to hold her ground, but is edged FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY. Sebastian, deep in his solo, doesn't notice. Mia tugs against the tide of the crowd, but to no avail. She's pushed to the back of the club, away from the lights and into shadow... The final chorus begins -- floor-shaking, fist-pounding. We linger on Mia's face -- watching as the band feverishly tear into their climactic bars, the dancers on-stage and the crowd below busting out one last burst of CRAZED CHOREOGRAPHY -- ending the song just as we SMASH CUT TO A TITLE CARD OVER BLACK: FALL Silence. We take a moment to collect ourselves before -- 92 OMIT 93 EXT. / INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - DAY CLOSE on Mia. She looks tired. A bit weathered. She's nursing a green tea across from Laura. They've finished eating. LAURA Look at him -- watch -- Mia glances out the window. A MAN in his early 40's has just parked, is walking around his car, inspecting it. LAURA (CONT'D) Now he's going to check the other window. Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check again. Yep, still closed. Mia smiles. The MAN enters the restaurant -- greets Mia -- and kisses Laura. This is HARRY. Her new boyfriend. HARRY Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything? MIA Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision 52. LAURA Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car. Harry rolls his eyes, heads to the front. Laura looks at Mia. LAURA (CONT'D) Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now? MIA I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure... A moment passes. LAURA You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. (Mia manages a smile; a beat) What's the matter? MIA Nothing... LAURA You miss him. MIA I guess. I'm adapting. LAURA (nods; then,) I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other. MIA He told me. LAURA I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... (Mia smiles) You've changed Seb. You know that? Laura means it positively -- but Mia seems concerned... MIA Do you think he's happy? LAURA Is he happy? MIA I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision 53. Laura shrugs. LAURA Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. (a beat) So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him. She notices Harry through the window, returning. Her thoughts drift. LAURA (CONT'D) Dreams change. A beat. She looks back at Mia. Sees her worry. LAURA (CONT'D) Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon. Harry rejoins the table. Hands Laura a sponge cake. LAURA (CONT'D) I told you not to get me anything! HARRY Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess. LAURA No -- I changed my mind. They laugh. Kiss. Tender. Loving. Mia watches... 94 INT. DINER - NIGHT Mia eats, her laptop next to her meal. She takes a bite, types. We see her screen -- an e-mail draft, glimpses of words: "one- woman show", "one night only", "7pm", "I would be thrilled..." She thinks. Picks up her phone. Dials Sebastian. Waits. No answer. MIA Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you... (a beat) Ok... Bye... She hangs up. Resumes typing. Revision 54. 95 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT COMPLEX / APARTMENT - NIGHT Mia walks through the courtyard. Reaches the door. Then hears something... Music -- LOUD, FAST JAZZ... She enters -- has to jostle the door handle to do so -- -- and then freezes in place. Sebastian is sashaying around a fully-decked table, lighting candles as he moves. He looks up, sees her -- and grins. SEBASTIAN Surprise. She lights up. He lifts up silver serving trays, revealing what he's cooked. Roast chicken. Pasta. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And... (he hurries to the kitchen -- and holds up a big apple pie) There's twenty-five pounds of apples in it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good. Mia laughs. Can't believe it. Sebastian looks at her -- sincere now. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you. Mia's eyes seem almost on the brink of tears. Beyond moved, she runs into Sebastian's arms. A LONG, HEARTFELT KISS... 96 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING CLOSE ON: The record player. An old jazz track. We see Mia and Sebastian seated at the table -- eating, drinking, laughing. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Feels so good to be home. MIA Stay. He smiles. SEBASTIAN How's the play going? MIA I'm nervous. Revision 55. SEBASTIAN Why? MIA Because... (a beat) What if people show up? SEBASTIAN Fuck `em! Laughter. Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're nervous about what they think? MIA I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified. SEBASTIAN They should be so lucky to see it. (then,) It's going to be incredible. I can't wait. MIA I can. A smile. Beat. MIA (CONT'D) What time do you leave in the morning? SEBASTIAN 6:45. MIA Ugh. SEBASTIAN Yep. Boise. MIA Boise? SEBASTIAN (nods) You should come. MIA To Boise? Revision 56. SEBASTIAN Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list. Mia laughs. MIA Wish I could. A beat. SEBASTIAN Why can't you? MIA Come to Boise? SEBASTIAN Yeah. MIA Because I have to rehearse. SEBASTIAN Can't you rehearse anywhere? She looks at him. MIA You mean anywhere you are? SEBASTIAN ...I -- I guess... MIA Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... SEBASTIAN Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other. MIA I know, but when are you done? SEBASTIAN ...What do you mean? MIA When are you done with the tour? Revision 57. SEBASTIAN But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour. Mia looks at him. Doesn't seem to understand. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record. Beat. Mia takes this in. MIA So it's...the long haul? SEBASTIAN ...What does that mean? MIA I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. SEBASTIAN What did you think I was going to do? MIA I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- SEBASTIAN You didn't think we'd be successful. MIA No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? SEBASTIAN Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. Beat. MIA Do you like the music you're playing? SEBASTIAN I don't know how that matters. MIA It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision 58. SEBASTIAN Do you like the music I'm playing? MIA Yes. I do. (beat) I just didn't think you did. SEBASTIAN Yeah, well, I -- MIA And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm -- SEBASTIAN What are you doing? Why are you doing this? MIA What do you mean why am I doing this? SEBASTIAN This is what you wanted from me. MIA To be in this band? SEBASTIAN To have a steady job. MIA Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club. SEBASTIAN So I'm doing that. So why aren't we celebrating? MIA Why aren't you starting your club? SEBASTIAN You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick -- MIA Change the name! SEBASTIAN -- and no one likes jazz. Not even you. Revision 59. MIA I do like jazz now, because of you. SEBASTIAN (not listening to her) What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to? MIA People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. SEBASTIAN Not in my experience. A beat. Mia realizes she's getting nowhere. A moment of quiet. Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know? This is what I'm doing. If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line. MIA (trying again) You had a dream that you were sticking to, that -- SEBASTIAN This is the dream! MIA This is not your dream. SEBASTIAN Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that? MIA Why do you care so much about being liked -- ? SEBASTIAN (finally bursting--) You're an actress, who are you to talk?? Silence. We suddenly realize -- Revision 60. -- the LP has finished. You can hear the needle scratch against it now -- back and forth, back and forth. Sebastian looks at Mia. A moment. Finally -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself. Mia looks back at him. Can't believe he said that. Tears starting to well in her eyes. She tries to suppress them. MIA Are you kidding? SEBASTIAN No. They stare at each other. Then -- all of a sudden -- the FIRE ALARM blares. Sebastian turns and sees smoke billowing from the KITCHEN. A dish in the oven has started to burn. Sebastian rises, springs toward the kitchen -- then sees Mia grabbing her things. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Wait -- But she's out the door. It slams shut, as Sebastian pulls the burnt apple pie from the oven. And on that -- WE SMASH CUT TO -- 97 OMIT 98 EXT. THEATER - DAY A poster, placed on the front of the theater we saw before. A title. A name below it: "MIA DOLAN." And a word: "TONIGHT." We spot Mia, carrying a box of props. She enters the theater. And we're -- 99 INT. THEATER - DAY The empty theater. Dark. Silent. Then -- a light turns on. Mia steps in. We stay WIDE. She seems small from this vantage point, surrounded by her props and backdrops. She takes a moment. Looks at all the empty seats. Revision 61. Takes a deep breath. Nervous. And then, nodding to herself -- you can do this -- she starts setting up... 100 INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY A BLAST of music. The Messengers have just finished a rehearsal. Sebastian packs his stuff, heads toward the exit, nodding to the others -- SEBASTIAN COLE See you tomorrow. See ya. -- when -- KEITH You good for tonight, right? Sebastian stops. Looks at Keith. SEBASTIAN ...Tonight? KEITH Seven. The photo shoot. (reading Sebastian's face, adding --) Mojo. A beat. Sebastian is confused. SEBASTIAN I thought that was next Thursday. KEITH No. It's tonight. We linger on Sebastian for a moment... KEITH (CONT'D) Is that ok? 101 EXT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY Sebastian stands out front. Checks his watch. Thinks... 102 OMIT 103 INT. THEATER / INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT People are shuffling into the theater. We DRIFT BACKSTAGE. Mia, now in a male suit and tie, watches behind a curtain. Checks her phone. 7:04. Breathes in. Nervous, and alone... She turns. Nods to the OWNER, off to the side. He heads to a switch, and the lights GO DOWN. Revision 62. You can hear the murmurs beyond the curtain. The audience, expecting. Mia tries to get her nerves under control. She can do this... Sets her phone aside -- one last breath -- -- and walks out. 104 OMIT 105 OMIT 106 INT. PHOTO STUDIO - NIGHT LOUD MUSIC. It's the band's song, blaring from a speaker. They're pantomiming -- the musicians styled and ready for their close-ups. A PHOTOGRAPHER grabs shots. PHOTOGRAPHER Put a light on the drums... I need more fill in this corner... We ZERO IN on Sebastian. His hair sticks out at various angles. An artfully-undone tie hangs from his neck. He fake-plays, as Keith pretends to lay in sampled beats... Keith, Tom, Malcolm, Cole -- they all grin, as excited as kids. Sebastian looks at them -- then down at his elaborate outfit, then back up at the Photographer running around, then at his watch... PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Bass, head up. Piano, look down at the keys. Sebastian does as told, but his thoughts are elsewhere. The Photographer moves in close, SNAPPING shots of just him -- PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Cut the music. Turn the keyboard live. Piano look up, play. The track stops. Sebastian stops as well. The CLICKS of the Photographer's camera loud now. PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) No -- piano -- actually play something. Sebastian is still. Then he starts to play a single melody on the keys. We recognize it. The first notes of his and Mia's song... Revision 63. PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Good, now bite your lip like you're concentrating on a solo. Beat. Sebastian stops. Silence. He stares ahead. PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) That was good. Don't stop. We PUSH IN on Sebastian... 107 INT. THEATER - NIGHT We're CLOSE on Mia. In ordinary clothes now. Behind her is a wallpapered wall, and a small window. By her side are the globe we saw in her room, and other little trinkets: a pearl necklace, an old suitcase, a roll of maps. Outside the window, projection of a starlit Parisian night sky. Completely silent, Mia moves to a lamp, turns it off. We go BLACK. Then -- the house lights go on. White, fluorescent. Thin applause can be heard. Mia manages a smile, as we finally see -- -- that the theater is less than a quarter full. Mia takes a bow. Peers out. One seat, in the front row, has a "RESERVED" sign on it. The seat is empty. 108 OMIT 109 INT. THEATER - DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia slips inside, holding in her hurt. Starts collecting a few outfits -- then overhears two AUDIENCE MEMBERS outside -- AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.S.) I swear to God, if I have to hear one more hipster waxing nostalgic I'm gonna slit my wrists. AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.S.) Seriously. AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.S.) She's not even good. That window thing...? AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.S.) Christ... Don't quit your day job... Revision 64. Laughter. Mia freezes. The nail in the coffin. The voices fade. She slides into a chair. 110 EXT. THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian SPEEDING. Screeching to a stop. He's at Mia's THEATER. He dashes out and runs to the door. But it's locked. No one's in sight. Fuck. He spins around, frantic -- when Mia appears from an adjacent doorway, alone and carrying her box of props to her car. SEBASTIAN Mia! She turns. Sees him. He runs to her. WRAPS his arms around -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry -- -- and KISSES her. The kind of kiss that might once have swept her off her feet. He starts to move with her... ...starts to DANCE -- but -- MIA Stop -- She pulls away. Steps back. Sebastian looks at her. Unmoored. SEBASTIAN I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you -- MIA It's over. She doesn't say the words with any anger. Just acceptance. SEBASTIAN (a beat; then --) ...What do you mean? MIA I'm done embarrassing myself. SEBASTIAN You didn't embarrass yourself... Revision 65. MIA No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. She says this as though just realizing it. Sebastian looks at her. A moment passes. He doesn't know what to say now. MIA (CONT'D) I'm gonna go home for a while. SEBASTIAN ...This is home. MIA Not anymore. Sebastian is silent now. A tear in his eye. He clenches his jaw. Mia looks at him one more time, steps into her car, and drives off. Sebastian lingers. Doesn't move. Silence. Then, music. Soft, melancholy, just piano, as... 111 OMIT A111 OMIT ...WE DISSOLVE TO: 112 OMIT 113 EXT. MIA'S CAR - DAY Mia drives, boxes stacked in the back. A113 She gets on the 405... Heading out of the city... 114 EXT. / INT. MIA'S HOUSE - NEVADA - DUSK Mia steps inside a modest house. Her MOM is by the door. Hugs her. Her DAD stands by the hallway. 115 INT. MIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DUSK Mia enters her old bedroom. Slides in a suitcase. Moves a couple of boxes from the hall. Looks around. Old photos. Old soccer trophies. She sits down on the bed. Takes a breath. And, finally, we're... 116 EXT. ORANGE GROVE - DAY Laura and Harry's ENGAGEMENT PARTY. We're outside, in a sun- dappled grove. A small gathering. Revision 66. Sebastian plays a baby grand piano -- the source, we realize, of the music we've been hearing... As he watches Laura dance with her new fiancé -- this woman he has known for so many years as a romantic cynic, now once again full of all the youthful innocence of first love -- his thoughts seem to drift. The music comes to a close and... 117 LATER: Sebastian with Laura, by the orange trees... LAURA You remember the McKenzies? SEBASTIAN Oh God, I didn't see them. LAURA Yeah. They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so handsome". Sebastian smiles. Then -- SEBASTIAN You look beautiful. (beat) I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while. LAURA You were great (pause) You're always great when you play. Sebastian is silent. Then -- LAURA (CONT'D) Now -- listen to me. I want you to save for a down payment. You understand? You need a home. SEBASTIAN Yes ma'am. LAURA I'm not gonna be hovering anymore. SEBASTIAN ...You still think New York? LAURA I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know, it's exciting... Sebastian smiles again. Some calls from the distance -- Revision 67. LAURA (CONT'D) Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws... She lights up. Likes the sound of that. LAURA (CONT'D) Is my...my hair...? Sebastian, without a word, pulls a strand back. Laura smiles, kisses him on the cheek. A quiet, tender moment. Then she hurries off. Sebastian stands there. Watches... WE FADE OUT. 118 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING RINGING. Sebastian is awoken. Groaning, he rolls over. Lets the phone ring. It keeps going. Endless... Finally, fed up, he reaches for it. Answers -- SEBASTIAN What...? WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan. Sebastian is taken aback. He goes to hang up, saying just -- SEBASTIAN Wrong number. WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- She's not answering her cell and I was told I might find her here. Sebastian pauses. Hurt by the mere mention of Mia's name -- SEBASTIAN Yeah, well...not anymore. WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Ok. If you do talk to her -- SEBASTIAN I won't. WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt Casting is trying to reach her. A beat. Sebastian sits up. Suddenly wide-eyed. SEBASTIAN "Casting"...? Revision 68. 119 INT. MIA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Dinner has just finished. Mia's Mom gives her a kiss -- MIA'S MOM MIA Night, sweetie. Night, Mom. -- and heads off, as Mia and her Dad stay behind. Getting up to scrape the dish -- MIA'S DAD You want some more rice? MIA I'm ok. MIA'S DAD You look hungry. MIA I'm good... A moment. Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits back down across from her. MIA'S DAD It's fun having you back. Your mom ditches me at ten. Mia laughs. A moment. MIA You took down the swing. MIA'S DAD She made me. A smile. MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) I've still got all your old tapes. MIA Oh God. Throw those away. MIA'S DAD Never. Just then -- a loud, persistent HONK. Mia's Dad looks up, eyebrow raised. Mia turns, hearing it as well. The HONKING is nearby -- just outside... Mia's thoughts suddenly sharpen. Ears perk up. She's heard the honking before: Revision 69. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) What the hell...? Disbelief on Mia's face. It can't be. She heads to the nearest window. There -- at the corner, smack-dab in front of her house -- is SEBASTIAN'S CAR. A NEIGHBOR angrily yells at him. Sebastian sees Mia. They lock eyes. And on that -- 120 EXT. MIA'S HOME / SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER Mia and Sebastian stand next to his car. MIA Why did you come here? SEBASTIAN Because I have good news. MIA Ok... SEBASTIAN Amy Brandt. The casting director. MIA I know who she is. SEBASTIAN She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. He's brimming over with excitement. But Mia just shakes her head. MIA I'm not going. SEBASTIAN ...Excuse me? MIA I'm -- no... That will kill me. SEBASTIAN That's it? MIA Yes. Revision 70. SEBASTIAN So you're happy here? MIA I'm happier. SEBASTIAN Why won't you come? MIA I told you. SEBASTIAN I don't buy it. MIA (finally letting it out, fed up --) Because it's another audition! (a beat; then --) I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do you want to know what happens? Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- (beat) -- because -- SEBASTIAN Because what? MIA Because I'm probably not good enough. SEBASTIAN Yes you are. MIA No. Maybe I'm not. A beat. MIA (CONT'D) Maybe I'm one of those people who's always wanted to do it but never had a chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's like you said. Maybe I need to grow up. She hesitates. Continues -- Revision 71. MIA (CONT'D) I can go back to school. I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore. Beat. But Sebastian isn't giving up. SEBASTIAN Why? MIA Why what? SEBASTIAN Why don't you want to do it anymore? Mia thinks about this one for a moment. MIA ...Because it hurts a little bit too much. Sebastian shakes his head. Nope. Won't accept this. SEBASTIAN I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't. With that, he gets back into his car. Mia is silent. Then -- MIA How did you find me? Sebastian turns. Points. Matter-of-fact -- SEBASTIAN The house across from the library. He drives off. Mia looks up. There, sure enough, is the LIBRARY, crouched on the corner. The library that once helped set her on her path to acting. She looks at it. Thinks... 121 EXT. MIA'S STREET - NIGHT/DAY Wide on the street. All is quiet. Night becomes morning... Revision 72. 122 EXT. MIA'S HOME - DAY Sebastian's car pulls over. He sits there. Sips a coffee, a second coffee in the holder. The time: 8:02. A moment passes. He taps the wheel. Looks at the house. The front door remains closed. No Mia. He leans back. Seems worried. Closes his eyes, breathes out. We MOVE CLOSE on him. He breathes in and out again... He opens his eyes. 8:10. The door's still closed. Resigned, he starts his car up, BEGINS TO PULL AWAY, when -- -- BAM! A KNOCK on the opposite window. He jumps. It's Mia. She's just arrived at the car from the other side, two just-bought cups of coffee and a bag of pastries in her hands. A beat. Sebastian smiles. Then OPENS the door for her. 123 OMIT 124 EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIO LOT - DAY A cloudy late afternoon. Mia and Sebastian slowly walk through the lot together. They pass the New York street, the murals and posters of classic Hollywood, the old Art Deco ornaments and the big soundstages and backdrops. Neither says a word... 125 INT. WAITING LOBBY - DAY Mia and Sebastian are seated. Waiting. The DOOR opens. An ACTRESS exits. A second later -- ASSISTANT #2 Mia? Mia gathers her nerves. Gets up. And steps in. 126 INT. AUDITION ROOM / INT. LOBBY - DAY In the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. Seated behind her is the director, FRANK. AMY BRANDT MIA Hi, Mia. Hi. AMY BRANDT I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you. Mia nods. Smiles. A moment. AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script. Revision 73. FRANK We want to build the character with you. It's a process. Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot. MIA ...Ok. AMY BRANDT So why don't you just tell us a story? MIA ...About...? AMY BRANDT About anything. Mia nods again. A moment. AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) Whenever you're ready. Mia thinks. She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. It seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to choke the audition. We fear she may botch this completely... A126 WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia's silence. On edge... Worried... B126 WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... Brandt and Frank waiting... MIA My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... (beat) I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... She pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION] Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch to song signals just that. Mia's nerves fade away -- all the accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. This is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful... She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion -- all the so-called "fools" who take the plunge. She sings about them and for them. This is why Mia does what she does -- why she simply has no choice... The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. Then... Revision 74. ...WE DISSOLVE TO: 127 EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY Mia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched behind them. The clouds have parted, and it's now a gorgeous Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk. Sebastian looks at Mia. A moment passes. SEBASTIAN When do you find out? MIA They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out. SEBASTIAN You're going to get it. MIA No, I'm not. SEBASTIAN You are. I know these things. A beat. MIA Where are we? Sebastian looks at her. SEBASTIAN Griffith Park. MIA I mean -- where are we? SEBASTIAN I know... (beat) I don't know. MIA What do we do? SEBASTIAN I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this -- MIA If I get this -- Revision 75. SEBASTIAN When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got. Beat. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's your dream. MIA What are you going to do? SEBASTIAN I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know... A moment. Mia nods. Sebastian looks at her again. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz there. And you love jazz now. Mia smiles. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Right? MIA Right. Another moment. And then, finally -- SEBASTIAN I guess we're just going to have to wait and see. Mia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. She nods. MIA You know I'm always going to love you. SEBASTIAN I'm always going to love you too. Beat. Sebastian looks up at the Observatory. SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Look at this view. MIA (playfully) I've seen better. Revision 76. SEBASTIAN Agreed. They laugh. Then, almost to herself -- MIA I've never been here during the day. Sebastian smiles. A moment. We CUT TO WIDE. Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. We linger here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond. And then, ever so slowly... ...we FADE TO: WINTER A palm tree, a cloudless sky. We PULL BACK -- to reveal it's all painted... 128 EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY We're on a studio lot, looking at one of the old painted backdrops, of a palm tree and sky. A new title card: Five years later... We TILT down to the studio's entryway. A CAR enters. A WOMAN steps out. We don't see her face. We FOLLOW her from behind. She walks elegantly, poised. The wind picks up a strand of her hair. She makes her way down side-streets we've seen before, past Parisian-style façades. Then enters a COFFEE SHOP we recognize... 129 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY The eyes inside all look the WOMAN's way. She reaches the counter -- and we finally SEE HER FACE: MIA Hi... Iced coffee, please. MIA looks different. Different haircut, different way of handling herself. The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. We recognize this as the shop where Mia used to work. A man who appears to be the NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee -- Revision 77. NEW MANAGER On us. MIA No, no, that's fine. Mia hands over a few dollar bills. Then drops another bill into the tip jar. The Barista smiles. 130 EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER Mia exits the coffee shop...and is met by a CREW MEMBER on a GOLF CART. She gets on the cart -- and is driven away... CUT TO: CLOSE ON hands on piano keys, fluttering across the ivories. We PULL BACK: it's SEBASTIAN. We're in... 131 INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY ...a small jazz club. Simple, tasteful, cool. Stone arches in 1940's style. The seats close to the band, the piano in the center. The club has the same old-school character as the Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. It's polished, inviting. The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's before-hours. Sebastian finishes playing. Feels out the lowest keys once more, then the highest. Then turns and -- SEBASTIAN Alright, I'm done. (gets up) Harris did a nice job with it. EMPLOYEE Took him long enough. Sebastian smiles. SEBASTIAN No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels. EMPLOYEE I got a check for you to sign. SEBASTIAN How'd we do last month? EMPLOYEE Not too bad. Revision 78. SEBASTIAN (as he signs the check) Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the shoulder) See you tonight. EMPLOYEE See you tonight. 132 EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY Mia pulls into the driveway. 133 INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY She steps inside. Flowers and cards. We glimpse cursive "CONGRATULATIONS" written on a few of them. A stack of scripts on a nearby table. Her name visible. She drops her things, spots someone, goes in to kiss him. A long, tender, loving embrace, as we pull back... ...and see that it's not Sebastian. It's a MAN we haven't seen before: DAVID, mid-thirties. He and Mia kiss again. And, running over and grabbing Mia's leg, is a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL... 134 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING Sebastian steps in. The place is more habitable than his old digs. Fully furnished, warm and welcoming. He heads to the kitchen, pulls out some pork cutlets he's been thawing. We see, sitting on the counter, a Christmas card with a photo attached: Laura, Harry, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, all gathered on a couch and smiling at the camera. 135 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Sebastian eats his meal, in a new shirt and pants. Checks his watch. 136 EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY Sebastian pulls up outside the club. New car, same style. Gets out and passes by a movie poster as he walks. We can't see the title, but we can catch a glimpse of a face on it. It's MIA... 137 INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT We're back in the club. Revision 79. It's bustling now -- the BARTENDERS setting up, DOORMEN coming in, MUSICIANS sound-checking. Sebastian enters, the musicians greet him -- DRUMMER King Seb! SEBASTIAN Hothouse Eddie -- miss me? DRUMMER Like the desert misses the rain. And then -- we see a SAXOPHONIST we recognize. One of the old Lighthouse players. SAXOPHONIST Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight. SEBASTIAN Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh? SAXOPHONIST That's not Edgar. Laughs, pats on the back. 138 INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - NIGHT Mia, in a new outfit, crosses the living area and grabs her purse and jacket. David is by the door, jacket on as well. Mia bends back around a sofa, where the GIRL we saw before is seated next to a nineteen-year-old baby-sitter, CHELSEA. MIA Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea. The Girl nods. Mia kisses her forehead. Heads to the door. CHELSEA Bye, Mrs. Dolan. 139 OMIT 140 INT. CAR - NIGHT David drives, Mia seated beside him. They're on the 101. Gridlock traffic up ahead. DAVID What if we miss this? What do we tell Natalie? Revision 80. MIA We can just see it back in New York... David nods. Looks at the time on the car. 8:06. 141 INT. CAR - LATER Mia and David are seated. Still not moving. Mia looks at the clock again: 8:27. MIA (CONT'D) Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off here and get dinner? David looks at her. Smiles. DAVID Alright... 142 EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT Mia and David walk down a street. A few open restaurants and bars, a few other closed storefronts. A lot of old, weathered buildings: 1930's stucco, Art Deco signs. Then -- David's ears perk up. He hears something. MUSIC... He looks around. Doesn't see the source. Heads to the end of the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a building. Seems to be where the music's coming from... Mia heads over, curious. The music grows louder -- sounds like a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door... ...and then FREEZES. The sign on the door reads: "SEB'S". It's written the way she drew it for Sebastian, years ago... Coming up to her side, oblivious -- DAVID (CONT'D) This looks fun. David edges past Mia. Glimpses the bar inside. Turns to her, inviting -- DAVID (CONT'D) Come on... Mia doesn't know what to say. She follows David... Revision 81. 143 INT. JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS Inside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. The seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans, older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It's an excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles. Mia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. She recognizes the images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. Recognizes a stool by the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's... DAVID (CONT'D) Mia? She turns to David. Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the bandstand... The combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises from the keys, waves "thanks". And -- just then -- Sebastian appears. Mia looks at him, frozen. SEBASTIAN (taking the microphone) Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. (more applause) I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle Bells". The crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them -- -- and sees Mia. Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first time they've seen each other in years. A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless. Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Seb's. More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys. He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys -- -- and finally starts playing. Revision 82. A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize... It's Mia and Sebastian's song. Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys. This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded. We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon... 144 ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time... Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece. We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and -- MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but instead of brushing past her -- -- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages. A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin -- and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE] 145 INT. NEW APARTMENT - DAY Mia and Sebastian push open a new door -- to their new place. It's a shabby one-bedroom -- but it's theirs... 146 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT Next, Keith approaches Sebastian at the Lighthouse -- but Sebastian immediately shakes his head "no". 147 INT. THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian watches Mia perform -- it's the night of her play. He stands up to applaud -- and behind him, the entire theater, utterly packed, rises as well. A huge standing ovation. Mia's ROOMMATES are there, giddy with joy, as are LAURA and HARRY... Revision 83. 148 INT. STUDIO SOUNDSTAGE - DAY / NIGHT Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all.. This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. A painted- backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when parking on the lot... The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss- covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio- backdrop imagination. We've entered a fully fantastical realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's and 50's... A148 Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the street performers and the cops and the guards... AMY BRANDT races up to Mia -- seems to beckon her to audition... We see the audition silhouetted against a wall... We don't hear Mia sing, but the music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to... B148 PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We chart the journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old- Hollywood-movie way... Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The Sacré-Coeur and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching before us... And then a sign -- "CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE"... C148 We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club. Sebastian plays, on cloud nine... C148pt We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes, decked in movie-movie glow. We're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for the TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE in close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell -- D148 -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Mia and Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another... And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like all the stars of the galaxy... ...they DANCE. Revision 84. This is the last time we'll ever see them dance, and they seem to recognize that, so graceful and poised are their movements... Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than a real romance could ever be... We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam... 16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets of light... Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together -- and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as we move in closer on the imagery: 149 The first home... (16mm) 150 Mia's pregnancy... (16mm) 151 The newborn child... (16mm) 152 The child's first birthday... (16mm) 153 The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm) Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies... These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... The SCORE continuing to sway and taking us right up to... 154 Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother, hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look here is unaffected, just everyday. The MUSIC quiets slightly, everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple hit the road... 155 ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take a side route, winding up in another part of L.A... 156 ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo playing somewhere... 157 ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian's club... They sit down to listen... And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody... ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it. The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as Mia and Sebastian look into each other's eyes, lean in and, softly, but with all the love in the world... ...KISS. Revision 85. 158 WE CUT BACK TO THE PIANO: Sebastian has just finished his piece. We're back to reality. The audience in the club applauds. Beat. Mia looks at Sebastian. Looks away. A moment passes. DAVID Do you want to stay for another? She's silent for a second. Then she looks at David. MIA No... We should go. He nods. They rise from their seats and head for the exit. Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns and looks back at Sebastian. He looks at her. Their eyes lock. A hint of a tear in both... And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles. It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still thinks of it to this day... Then she walks out the door. Sebastian glances at his fellow musicians. Then, he nods, and they launch into a new chart. 159 EXT. STREET - NIGHT It's silent outside. You can't hear the music. Mia and David reach their car. They get in. It pulls out. Passing by Sebastian's club, the car continues on. We stay put, the jazz club on one side of the frame, the lights of the car on the other. Those lights growing smaller and smaller, before finally disappearing into the big L.A. night... IRIS FADE OUT. THE END

THE REVENANT Written by Mark L Smith Based on the novel by MICHAEL PUNKE September 26, 2007 Revenge is an act of passion; vengeance of justice. - Samuel Johnson Based on a true story FADE IN: EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp... clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on an otherwise barren tree. A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down, landing in the slow current of the Missouri. The last leaf of the fall, taking its final journey south. As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement... the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING. And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN'S VOICES, as we rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR at the center of the river. Beyond the flatboat are the voices... TWENTY MEN of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for makeshift rooftops. And this camp is full of life because these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for them to claim their share. EXT. CAMP - EVENING CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. He stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to be a member of some exclusive club. He pulls off one of his gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm. From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. He nudges MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life. FITZGERALD Likely got a splinter. Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him. Boone chuckles... spits in Henry's direction. 2. BOONE Need a doc, Captain? Henry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him. He slides his glove back on. HENRY Gather more wood. Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an exaggerated salute. FITZGERALD (under his breath) Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too. Boone snickers. Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) We got a plan for these fires, Captain, or are we roastin' berries all the way up to Fort Union? HENRY Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just make sure you have the fires ready. FITZGERALD My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. Hell, my belly feels full already. Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does, we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT. CUT TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN ANSTADT RIFLE. The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel. VOICE (O.S.) Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass! 3. Glass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and filthy, races past. PIG (CONT'D) Square as a barn door. JIM BRIDGER, (17), young eyes that have already seen a lot, nods to Glass as he follows Pig. Glass watches Pig and Bridger trot through the trees to a fallen ELK. Glass walks calmly after them, graceful in this world... his rifle so comfortable in his hand it's like he was born with it there. Pig crouches over the dead elk... grins up at Glass. PIG (CONT'D) Right where you said he'd be. BRIDGER But bigger than we figured. Gonna be a load to haul back to camp. PIG Have to split it up I reckon. GLASS Yep. Bridger'll take the tail, and Pig you haul the rest. And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow, because he just nods... pulls out his knife to cut the tail off for Bridger. Bridger and Glass exchange a smile... until Glass notices something... steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the ground beside it. He runs a finger over the dirt... touches a broken twig. BRIDGER Another one close by? Glass doesn't answer... studies the track... feels the nearby brush... inhales the scent from his hand. Bridger and Pig watch him... exchange a confused glance. And then in a flash of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away. PIG Hugh? Glass just keeps running. Pig and Bridger chase after him. CUT TO: 4. EXT. CAMP - EVENING The men building fires... laughing... enjoying themselves. Boone on the outskirts, gathering branches. CUT TO: GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS... ...dodging trees... leaping over fallen logs... loading his Anstadt as he runs. BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS... ...but not as gracefully. Pig trips... slams to the ground... scrambles back to his feet to continue on. CUT TO: BOONE - CARRYING AN ARMLOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP... ...seeing other men playing cards. He stops along the edge of camp, drops the wood to the ground. BOONE No rule says I'm the only one that's gotta gather this shit. The other men don't even notice. Then an ARROW WHIZZES THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone... THWACK... it hits him in the back of the neck... erupts out the front of his throat. Boone stands frozen... confused... reaches up and grabs the bloody arrow... finally drops to his knees. And that's when a TRAPPER looks up... sees Boone on his knees, holding that arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish. AND BEYOND BOONE ARE FORTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH THE TREES... FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR SHAVED HEADS... FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE. TRAPPER `REE! WHOOSH... AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER'S CHEST, sending him flying backward. The camp explodes into chaos... men YELLING... grabbing for weapons... stumbling over each other as they duck behind trees. 5. HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT... ...taking aim at the attacking figures. The Arikara pour into camp, arrows flying... knives and hatchets swinging. And this is a massacre... the Arikara wading through the trappers... stabbing... clubbing... scalping. This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening mix of war cries and screams of death. Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle... BOOM... takes down one of the warriors. He starts reloading as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife. Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn't going to make it in time... the warrior leaps toward him... ...BOOM... it's like the warrior hits an invisible wall... flies back to the ground, very dead. Fitzgerald spins... sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him. GLASS GET TO THE BOAT! Fitzgerald takes off... flips his rifle around, swings it like a club across a warrior's head... WHACK! GLASS (CONT'D) (TO HENRY) THE BOAT, CAPTAIN! Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. An arrow drives into the trapper's leg... he goes down. Henry lifts the man to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in the man's back... he falls limp. Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS, dropping the WARRIOR. Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING back at the attacking Arikara. The water deepens, and they start swimming toward the flatboat. ARROWS HISS into the water all around them. Glass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol... BAM... shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after the other men... joins them as they near the flatboat. A final TRAPPER charges down the shore behind them. SEVERAL WARRIORS pursue him. TRAPPER WAIT! 6. He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the trigger... CLICK... pulls it again... CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face first into the shallows. The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the wooden boat. Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back into the river. Bridger flails in the water... watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's head. The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck. BRIDGER Thank you. But Glass is already gone... FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as the current carries them away. VOICE (O.S.) HEY! Pig looks over the side... sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON gripped to the edge. Pig pulls him onto the boat. Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the river's bottom to pick up speed. Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp. Henry drops his eyes... can't watch. The TRAPPER'S SCREAM ECHOES OVER HIM. EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER Quiet and dark... the battle long over. The flatboat floats with the gentle current. The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are scattered around the deck... 7. Glass digging an arrow out of WALLACE MURPHY'S SHOULDER... Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other... STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig standing patrol with their rifles... Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off blankly. FITZGERALD What's the plan, Captain? Henry's still lost in those screams. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Captain! What the hell do we do now? Henry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously doesn't have an answer. ANDERSON We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union. Henry's eyes instinctively look to Glass. GLASS The Missouri's no good. Not if the `Ree's running it. FITZGERALD So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us? GLASS We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up. FITZGERALD Add weeks to the trip. BRIDGER Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river. FITZGERALD (shoving him away) Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this. Bridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops him. 8. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) (back to Henry) And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. (off the badly wounded TRAPPER) Thirteen before long. HENRY I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union. Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls those dark eyes to Anderson. Glass gives Henry a nod. EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER... NOW DEAD... ...as hands push the body over the side of the boat. It splashes into the water... floats downstream. We PULL BACK... see that the flatboat is beached along the bank of the river. Glass and Pig watch the body drift away. PIG Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him... take his ears... slice what's left all to shit. Glass nods... steps down off the boat to Henry and the others. They're gathered around a map spread out on the ground. Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE. HENRY So we hike west to the Grand, then follow it up to Fort Union. FITZGERALD On foot? You got any idea how long that's gonna take? It'll be winter before we get there. ANDERSON Unless we come across a post... trade for some horses. 9. GLASS No posts that far out. FITZGERALD So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet. HENRY We make camp here for the night, then load supplies and head out for the Grand at first light. (BEAT) And gather extra blankets `cause there won't be any fires. More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they move toward the cover of trees. Bridger walks up beside Glass. BRIDGER Thank you... for what you done back there. GLASS You'd have done the same for me. Bridger nods... he hopes so. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT Pig on watch... sitting at the base of a tree, rifle across his lap, eyes wide, scanning the darkness. All clear. He peers back to camp... Fitzgerald, Anderson, Stubby Bill, and Murphy wrapped in blankets... passing a bottle of whiskey around. Bridger across from Fitzgerald, poking at the dirt with a stick. Henry is off to one side, still studying that map. Glass sits against a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle. Fitzgerald watches Glass a beat, then... FITZGERALD You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass. STUBBY BILL Never seen a woman that could stop a `Ree from three hundred feet. ANDERSON I knew a particular big-breasted redhead in Boston that might come close. 10. The others manage a small laugh. Glass just keeps working on that rifle. FITZGERALD Bring it over here for me to have a look. Glass doesn't look up... wipes a rag down the barrel. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said, boy? Still nothing from Glass. And Fitzgerald doesn't like that... the tension's growing. BRIDGER (MUMBLING) You seen it before. Fitzgerald turns that mean, drunken glare on Bridger. FITZGERALD What'd you say, kid? Bridger hesitates a beat... until the other men's eyes force a response. BRIDGER (SOFTLY) I said you shoulda already got a look when he saved you with it earlier. The camp falls still... nobody talks to Fitzgerald like that... especially when he's drunk. There isn't a sound except for Glass working methodically on his rifle... ...until the SWISH OF BLADE OVER LEATHER, as Fitzgerald tears the blade from his belt... flings it into the dirt between Bridger's legs... AN INCH BELOW HIS CROTCH. Fitzgerald stares at Bridger, daring him to react. But Bridger's too scared... doesn't, so Fitzgerald just smiles. FITZGERALD You're lucky you ain't a man yet. (off the blade) Else that mighta nicked somethin'. A few NERVOUS CHUCKLES from the others, hoping this is over. And it is, because Fitzgerald reaches over and pulls the knife away... cleans the dirty blade on Bridger's leg. 11. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And unlike you, I don't need savin' by him or nobody else. Remember that. Fitzgerald stands... wobbles just a bit. He slides the knife back into his belt, then steadies his drunken gaze on Glass. The others exchange nervous glances... uh-oh. Fitzgerald walks to Glass... snaps his fingers for Glass' Anstadt. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Lemme see what's so special `bout that shooter of yours. Nothing from Glass, so Fitzgerald grabs the barrel, but Glass holds firm. GLASS Middle of workin' on it. FITZGERALD Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said. Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows tighter. His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he isn't giving up his rifle. And they hold that stare just as hard as they're holding Glass' rifle. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You forget your place? GLASS Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end of my rifle. Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to the trigger. But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't let him lose this tug of war. FITZGERALD I'd be careful if I was you, boy. And this thing's about to turn real ugly... until... HENRY That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go sober up and get to sleep. (MORE) 12. HENRY(CONT'D) If you're passed out when we break camp tomorrow, I leave you here. Fitzgerald holds his glare on Glass, then releases the rifle, shoving it back at Glass. He glances to Henry, and throws back a big gulp from the bottle just for spite, before backing away from Glass. FITZGERALD That's the trouble with this part of the world. No mirrors. Niggers forget what color they are. Glass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle. Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself. Glass glances up from his work... just long enough to give Bridger a nod. EXT. CAMP - LATER Fitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey. The others snoring in a cluster at the center of the camp. Henry lies there awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the darkness. Henry eases over to Glass. HENRY Can't sleep either? GLASS Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em. HENRY I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river. GLASS The tracks I saw... those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. They'd have gone as far north as it took. (BEAT) You're a good man, Captain. Soon as you realize that, these others will too. Henry likes hearing that... still isn't sure it's true. 13. HENRY Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much experience with the Arikara? GLASS Enough to try and stay outta their way. HENRY (motions to Glass' map) But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to Fort Union? GLASS I been here a long while. Whether that gets us to Union or not... Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. So he just nods and starts back to his blanket.... stops. HENRY What Fitzgerald said earlier... he doesn't speak for the rest. GLASS He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin. HENRY (BEAT) Try to get some sleep, Hugh. Henry climbs back under his blanket. Glass just sits there looking at the map. ANGLE ON GLASS' MAP... ...primitive at best. Sketched mountains... winding blue lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names beside them... "Brazeau", "Talbot", "Union". And DOZENS OF TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless wilderness. We TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we're lost in them. DISSOLVE TO: 14. EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Thick with trees. Henry leads the men single file through the woods. They each have a canvas sack of supplies over one shoulder, and their rifle in their hands. The only sound is their feet crunching the dried leaves, and even that seems too loud as their eyes dart about, searching for any sign of attack. STUBBY BILL Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by now? HENRY We'll reach it soon enough. Glass said to keep this course. FITZGERALD Glass said. Too bad I don't see him. PIG That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get to keep your ears. Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance. FITZGERALD Or he's run off and left us. BRIDGER He wouldn't do that. Fitzgerald GRUNTS... doesn't believe that. FITZGERALD My bet, that nigger's used to runnin'. EXT. WOODS - DAY Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding... subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves... careful not to leave his scent behind. And his eyes cut through the trees as he moves... digging for any sign of movement. He spots something at his feet... crouches down, running his finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt. 15. O.S. RUSTLING snaps his head up... to the TREMBLING OF BUSHES... growing harder... whatever's in there is coming toward Glass. He calmly raises his rifle... presses the stock firmly against his shoulder... closes one eye as he takes steady aim down the long barrel... ...to the shapes rumbling out of the brush... TWO BEAR CUBS playfully wrestling. Glass lowers the Anstadt... looks past the cubs for something else... but the woods are empty. A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS' EYES... ...he spins... right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW AT HIM... hitting him across the side of the neck. The animal's razor claws tear into Glass' throat, as the force sends him flying through the air. Glass sails into a thick tree... the CRACK OF HIS LEG SNAPPING against the trunk. The rifle falls from his hand. The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR... charges Glass. Glass crawls to the Anstadt... grabs it... has just enough time to tilt the rifle toward the bear... BOOM. CUT TO: HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST. HENRY UP AHEAD! Henry takes off at full sprint. The other men follow. CUT TO: GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM... ...tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing. Glass hits the ground with a PAINFUL THUD. He starts CRAWLING AWAY, pulling the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant behind him... swings... tears its claws across Glass's back, shredding deep into his flesh. Glass is fighting for his life now... flailing with the knife... slicing it across the bear's paw as it whips past him. The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start crawling again. But the Grizzly doesn't give Glass the chance... ROARS... is on him in a flash, a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS... tearing across Glass' head... ripping into his face... his chest. 16. Glass drives his knife into the bear again... deep... trying to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital. CUT TO: HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST. CUT TO: GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE... ...locked in a death grip... tumbling along the ground... trading violent blows... Glass' blade versus the Grizzly's claws and fangs... snapping small trees as they roll over them... toward the edge of a steep embankment... ... and ROLL DOWN... spinning over and over... each ROARING AT THE OTHER... Glass pounding the knife into the bear again and again as they fall... neither willing to surrender as they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace, then SLAM TO THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH. And the forest falls still... Glass hidden somewhere beneath the massive animal... both deathly motionless. EXT. WOODS - DAY Bridger's the first to reach the battleground... sees the TWO FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY. He follows the bloody ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope... looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom. BRIDGER Christ Almighty. Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge. HENRY Glass! No answer. And all they can see is the bear, so they scan the trees. PIG HUGH! Still nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the bear... sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT. 17. BRIDGER He's down here! Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the other men scramble down. But Bridger can't budge the massive carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass... ...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. His right leg is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin. Bridger's legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits. MURPHY Oh, Jesus. STUBBY BILL He's tore to pieces. The men stare down at Glass' corpse. ANDERSON Least he took that Grizz down with him. FITZGERALD Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. And that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig... turning his face into a bloody mess. Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald... drag him off. HENRY THAT'S ENOUGH! Then somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN. BRIDGER Holy Christ, he's alive. Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. Glass looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and pain. His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp. 18. HENRY Get me some water. Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. Henry empties it over Glass' throat... his face and scalp. The water hits the wounds and immediately transforms to blood. BRIDGER Oh, Jesus... Jesus. Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the gaping wound. His eyes widen in horror. He COUGHS... the air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat. HENRY It's okay, Hugh. (pushing Glass' hand away) You're going to be fine. Henry spins his head away from Glass. HENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) I need some rags before he bleeds out. Pig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it. HENRY (CONT'D) And your whiskey. Pig tosses a bottle to Henry. Henry pours it over the gashes. The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in that same horrific moan. HENRY (CONT'D) Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit. Bridger throws his weight against Glass' shoulders. HENRY (CONT'D) The rest of you spread out... scout a circle around us. Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. Murphy and Mike south and east. Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot. And for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men... firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would be. So the men hurry off to their positions. 19. PIG What about me, Cap? HENRY Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can. Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds. The blood keeps seeping out, soaking the rags. PIG It won't stop bleedin'. HENRY Shut up, Pig. (TO GLASS) We're fixing you up, Hugh. Glass is like a shredded rag doll... dazed eyes staring up at them as they work on his wounds... wrapping the rags around his throat... laying his scalp back over his skull, and tying another rag around it and under his jaw to hold it in place. Bridger wipes the blood from Glass' face. BRIDGER It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass. Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over his knees... oozing out from beneath Glass. HENRY Roll him over... easy. They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED, GASHES running across the width of Glass' back. Henry stares at the open flesh, ready to panic again... but he doesn't. Instead he looks to Pig. HENRY (CONT'D) Get me the kit. We need to stitch his back up. BRIDGER What about the rest of him? HENRY He's losing more blood back here. (off the throat) And I don't know what to do with that yet. 20. Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread... hands it to Henry. Henry grabs the whiskey bottle. HENRY (CONT'D) I'm sorry for how this is about to burn, Hugh. Henry pours the whiskey over Glass' back. And the pain must be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL. CUT TO: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees. Glass' scream erupts through the trees, and they both immediately crouch down to a knee... out of sight to anyone out there that might have heard that. ANDERSON They're torturin' the poor bastard. FITZGERALD And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. Proper thing would be to end it for him quick. ANDERSON `Less he could pull through. FITZGERALD You seen what that grizz did to him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that. EXT. WOODS - LATER SERIES OF SHOTS HENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS... Bridger and Pig pressing Glass' scalp down, as Henry slides the needle and thread through the skin, suturing the wound. HENRY CLEANING GLASS' SHREDDED THROAT. BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING THE SCREAMING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY SNAPS GLASS' LEG BACK IN PLACE. 21. FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES... to Henry doctoring Glass. Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger... turns back to the darkening forest. EXT. WOODS - EVENING Glass rests unconscious on the ground. Two branches act as a splint on his leg. A blanket covers his body... his face is like a swollen, disfigured, Frankenstein's monster... stitches of black thread holding it in place. Henry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his hands under a canteen. Bridger and Pig stand beside him. BRIDGER What now? HENRY We wait. Does he have any kin you know of? PIG He keeps to hisself. Never mentioned none. HENRY Go get the others. Tell `em we're making camp here for the night. Pig starts hustling away. HENRY (CONT'D) And gather some wood, but make sure it's dry. We don't want much smoke when we cook that grizzly. ANGLE ON THE MASSIVE BEAR... ...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with blood... Glass' blood. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT And what's left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs of flesh butchered from its skeleton. A fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts above the flame. The men sit around the fire... 22. Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing it in his mouth. The men are silent... the pall of Glass' attack still hanging over them. Bridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over it, grabbing the animal's enormous paw. It dwarfs his own hand, as he examines the claws. Bridger pulls out his knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS IT OFF AT ITS BASE. FITZGERALD (O.S.) What makes you think you earned a claw? Bridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You didn't take that grizz down. BRIDGER It ain't for me. Bridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass. Pig's already crouched beside him. Bridger lifts Glass' small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald. Pig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth. PIG I can feel some air outta his mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh? (off Bridger's silence) Whatta you figure his odds are, Jim? Bridger stares down at what's left of Glass. BRIDGER Long. EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING The sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across the treetops. EXT. CAMP - MORNING ANGLE ON GLASS... 23. ...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and staggered. The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him... ...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down at him. MURPHY What that bear did to him... I didn't expect he'd last this long. ANDERSON I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. Fever finally finished him off. STUBBY BILL Whatta we do, Cap? A long beat, then... HENRY We give him his chance. Henry turns and walks away. EXT. CAMP - NIGHT The fire has burned down to nothing. The men sleep scattered about. Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready, keeping watch. Glass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse. And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy, blood-soaked strains. Fitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass' gurgling. FITZGERALD You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way. Henry's awake, but doesn't answer. He's holding his pistol in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing Fitzgerald just said. But he doesn't move... not yet. Fitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling the sound. Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald's misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER STRAP... a necklace. 24. EXT. CAMP - MORNING Bridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on his head. Pig and Henry stand over them, watching. Fitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled across camp. ANDERSON Fever's hit. Won't be long now. FITZGERALD I seen a bad one drag on days. ANGLE ON GLASS... ...eyes open... he can hear every word. FITZGERALD (O.S.) (cont'd) Insides shut down... flesh starts to spoil and turn. Ain't no way for... HENRY (O.S.) Quiet, Fitzgerald. FITZGERALD... ...points a stick at Glass. FITZGERALD (TO HENRY) We keep sittin' here watchin' him die, only gives the `Ree more chance to find us. Henry doesn't answer... just keeps staring down at Glass. BRIDGER He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him. Henry considers this, then... HENRY Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. Grand should be just west of here. Find us the best route. FITZGERALD Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make sense for the rest of us, Captain. 25. HENRY (TO PIG) Get movin'. Pig nods... grabs his gear. He and Anderson take off out of camp. Henry turns... walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby Bill. HENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) You two can start digging a grave. Fitzgerald tosses the stick away. FITZGERALD Least it's a step in the right direction. EXT. CAMP - LATER Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep in Glass' grave. Stubby Bill stands over him. FITZGERALD Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal. He takes Stubby Bill's hand... pulls himself out. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Glass won't know the difference no ways. Pig and Anderson walk back into camp. PIG Found it, Cap. Right where Glass had us headed. ANDERSON No more than a mile or so out. Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass. HENRY We could build a litter. Haul him with us. ANDERSON It's rocky and steep goin'. Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer. 26. PIG Marshy and thick on the other side. We could try it, but... Pig shakes his head. FITZGERALD I signed on as a trapper, not a goddamn mule. BRIDGER (TO HENRY) Shape he's in... I don't see no way he'd make bein' drug. Henry nods, his mind racing for a solution. And before long, his hand is back on that pistol. He pulls it from his belt. The other men all drop their heads... except for Fitzgerald... he's ready to see this end. Henry stares down at Glass. HENRY Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger. BRIDGER But, Captain. HENRY Do it. Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass' wide open eyes. And Glass must know what's happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him. CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER... ...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... everything goes black. HENRY (O.S.) Step clear, Mr. Bridger. A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then... BACK TO SCENE 27. Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. His hand trembles slightly. Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears. Bridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry. Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms... because he's thought of something else. HENRY (CONT'D) There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. Then give him a proper burial. BRIDGER I'll stay with him... money or not. PIG Same here. HENRY I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to scout. Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not interested. HENRY (CONT'D) Just need one more. FITZGERALD Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears. HENRY A hundred then. Still nothing from the others. BRIDGER They can have my share too. I owe Glass that at least. FITZGERALD That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred. 28. HENRY But Glass is to be cared for until. Understood? FITZGERALD (motions to Bridger) I'll let the young doctor do his job. Henry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left. HENRY The rest gather your gear. Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face. Their eyes meet... Bridger gives Glass a nod. EXT. CAMP - LATER Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. Pig bends down over Glass. PIG I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh. Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. He moves the only thing he can... BLINKS a "yes" back at him. HENRY (to Fitzgerald and BRIDGER) As long as necessary. BRIDGER I'll look after him. Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the Grand... toward Fort Union. EXT. CAMP - NIGHT What's left of a small fire is nothing but smoldering ash. Bridger crouches beside Glass, pouring a thin stream of broth between his lips. Fitzgerald reaches in... grabs Glass' Anstadt leaning against the tree. FITZGERALD I'll take first watch. 29. BRIDGER Not with his rifle. FITZGERALD Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be needin' it tonight. Fitzgerald disappears into the trees. EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Pig stands on a ridge, scouting a course. He waves back to Henry and the others. They start toward him. EXT. CAMP - EVENING Glass conscious on the ground... that same labored breathing. CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON FITZGERALD... ...smiling down at Glass as he grabs the Anstadt, holds it... runs his hand down the barrel, as comfortable as if it were his own. FITZGERALD You were right to protect this. Then he disappears... and we're left alone, staring up at the branches above us... the evening sky... accompanied by Glass' deathly breaths. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WILDERNESS/CREEK - DAY Bridger kneels beside the stream, filling canteens. EXT. CAMP - DAY Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, twisting a knife in his hands... flipping it point first into the dirt... grabbing... repeating... twist... flip... thwack. And as he does, his eyes are locked on Glass. 30. Finally, Fitzgerald snaps the knife from the dirt, stands, and walks over to Glass. Glass is asleep. Fitzgerald crouches down over him... eyes his red, infected wounds. FITZGERALD (WHISPERS) When are you gonna die, boy? Fitzgerald reaches out with the blade... gently touches one of the threads holding Glass' throat together. And when he does, GLASS' EYES FLY OPEN... focus on Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald doesn't even flinch... just holds that knife tip there against Glass' throat. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'm nearly a week behind Henry's bunch on accounta havin' to tend to you. Be easier on us all if you'd take that last breath. The two men hold a stare... until Fitzgerald pulls back the knife... grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them... balls it up in his fist. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I could help ya with that if you'd like. Muzzle ya right now... end all this sufferin' quick and easy. Nobody'd ever know you give up. Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass' nose and mouth... holds it there, just inches above. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You just gimme a blink if you want me to do it. Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald's... both men unblinking. A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag... finally falls... lands on Glass' lips. Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable... as Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink. Suddenly Bridger's hand clamps down on Fitzgerald's shoulder. Fitzgerald spins... startled. BRIDGER (O.S.) What's goin' on? 31. Fitzgerald jumps with a start, sees it's Bridger, and is pissed that Bridger scared him... and interrupted his business. He rises quickly, planting his meaty hand in Bridger's chest, and SLAMMING HIM BACK AGAINST A TREE. FITZGERALD Don't you ever question me, you little piss-ant. Bridger tries to fight back, but Fitzgerald's too strong... holds him pressed against the tree... slams a heavy elbow into Bridger's mouth, splitting his lip. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'd just as soon leave both you and your nigger here to rot. `Cept killin' you ain't worth givin' up your share. (LEANS CLOSER) But that don't mean I can't be coaxed into changin' my mind. Fitzgerald shoves him away... Bridger stumbles and falls. Fitzgerald tosses the bloody rag at him. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And I was just doin' your job... cleanin' him up. Fitzgerald grabs Glass' Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say something. Of course Bridger doesn't. Fitzgerald walks toward the trees. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Why don't ya pour some more broth down his throat... keep him alive another week so we can fall farther back. End up walkin' all the way to Fort Union on our own. `Ree would love to poach on just two. (turns to Bridger) I promise ya, you'll look a helluva lot worse than Glass when they're done with you. Bridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes the blood from his lip with a trembling hand. DISSOLVE TO: 32. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT From high above the trees. The world is silent... peaceful... until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops. CUT TO: BLACK... ...the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING. FITZGERALD (V.O.) (PANICKED WHISPER) Bridger! Get your ass up! Dim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD'S FACE right in front of us. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) `Ree. BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE SLEEP FROM HIS FRIGHTENED EYES. BRIDGER What? FITZGERALD Keep quiet. I was down at the creek... there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way. BRIDGER Oh, shit. Whatta we do? FITZGERALD We run. Now. And Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power that Bridger has no response... watches as Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. Bridger is scared out of his mind... does the same... grabs for his rifle, resting near Glass. Bridger freezes... in his panic, he'd forgotten all about Glass. And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him... understanding perfectly what's happening around him. BRIDGER What about Glass? 33. FITZGERALD He's on his own, same as us. BRIDGER I can't leave him. FITZGERALD Then I'm talkin' to a dead man. Glass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go. But Bridger's frozen... doesn't know what to do... until Fitzgerald shoves him back to life. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Move. Glass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing for his weapon. Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but Fitzgerald grabs it first. BRIDGER What're you doin'? He needs that. FITZGERALD He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands. Glass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun. BRIDGER It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got! FITZGERALD And more than he'll need. Fitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well. BRIDGER We can't leave him with nothin'. But Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into the trees. Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes suddenly filled with a rage. And Bridger's frozen again, lost between duty and fear... until finally, he just shakes his head and takes off into the trees. Glass's empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side. He flops over to his stomach... GASPS IN PAIN... 34. then using his one good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his healthy leg pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel him forward... a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger... ...inch by inch... farther than he's been in days. But it's still only a few yards, and now he lies in the open... a clear target for the Arikara. Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him. He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES from the ground, then claws forward, each movement excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH. He rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of strength. Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the branches back up... spreading them across the hole as camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has. He lies there defenseless... INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE. Hiding... listening for the Arikara's arrival... waiting to die. CUT TO: GLASS' POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE... TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC... JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... AND THE SOUND OF HIS PAINFUL BREATHS. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING Cold and grey. Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire, warming his hands. WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky. FITZGERALD We ran the better part of six hours. Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others. Bridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening... staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and over. He notices the smoke. BRIDGER Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it. FITZGERALD We put enough distance between us and them. And it's too damn cold to go without one. 35. BRIDGER All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us. FITZGERALD (shakes his head) A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did. Bridger looks back to the trees... then considers something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before... BRIDGER It was twenty earlier. FITZGERALD What? BRIDGER When you woke me... you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree. FITZGERALD A dozen... twenty. I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many. Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the flames. Bridger stares at the water pouring out. BRIDGER What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night? (BEAT) I'd already brought plenty a water. Fitzgerald doesn't answer. Bridger tightens his grip on his rifle... slowly rises. BRIDGER (CONT'D) Answer me. FITZGERALD Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind. Bridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle at Fitzgerald. BRIDGER ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF! 36. Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey. Then Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy. FITZGERALD What're you askin'? Why it was you turned your back on Glass? Why you let him die to save your own sorry skin? (BEAT) `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why. BRIDGER The `Ree... did you see `em? (off Fitzgerald's silence) DID YOU SEE `EM? FITZGERALD (MOVING CLOSER) Not a one. Bridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when Fitzgerald's hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and shoving the butt back into Bridger's face... THWACK. The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it around to aim it at the boy. Blood drips down Bridger's head as he stares up at his rifle pointed down. Fitzgerald's finger tightens on the trigger. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that there is the answer to your question. And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT IN FEAR... THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes... sees Fitzgerald sneering down at him. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And the next time you aim to kill somebody, kid, best remember your gun won't fire without a flint. Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away. Bridger's face flushes with rage and humiliation... he charges Fitzgerald from behind... tackles him to the ground... starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches. A few of them land, but it's only a moment before Fitzgerald is back in control... HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him... 37. tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH... AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger off... ...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. He starts walking away. BRIDGER I'm goin' back for him. FITZGERALD Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now. Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife... covers the fire's remains. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And just so we're clear. If you try to backtrack without me knowin', or ever get so guilty you feel the need to tell somebody. Fitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'll have no choice but to gut you from nuts to nose. Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into his belt, and stands. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Now let's go. Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last glance behind him before following Fitzgerald. EXT. CAMP - MORNING Empty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS' HAND RISES BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth, pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out of his own grave. He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back hits the cold, hard surface. 38. Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with that one good arm. He makes it to the blanket... wraps it around him. Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move... his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water... and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any predator. So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN, and drags himself toward the cover of brush. And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm... inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a desperate, hopeless crawl for survival. But finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain overwhelm him. He collapses... falls unconscious. EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass lies in the dirt, weak... dehydrated... starving. He looks at his hands... scratched and bloody from clawing his weight. He unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR CLAW attached. Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands. He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy leg... pull with his good arm. EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER Glass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive stitching. The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT The wind is howling through the trees. Glass lies beneath a cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding. Every aching breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air. 39. EXT. MARSH - DAY Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature cornstalks. Looking down from above the marsh we see a two- foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of the marsh, and stops. We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying among the Cattails. He's sawing off one of the stalks with the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the tender flesh beneath. Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face... arms. But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws on the Cattail. EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth. He flinches as he swallows. He starts to move again, but freezes... listens... RUSHING WATER. Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy... pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and there it is at the bottom of the ridge... ...THE GRAND RIVER... WATER. Glass crawls down toward it. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Glass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding the pain to gulp it down. As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows beside him. He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it darts easily away. Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down his neck. He leans out over the surface to check his reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched- together, disfigured face staring back at him. He fights off the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag, and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river, then cleaning his wounds. 40. He runs a finger up to his shredded throat... around the open, wet hole. He cups another handful of water to his mouth... strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT OF THE HOLE. Glass shoves the cloth against the wound... tries to press the flesh together... no good. He dumps out his Possibles bag... stares at the meager contents. He picks up one of the flints... looks to the powderhorn. EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS... ...as Glass SPARKS one of the flints... ignites the grass. As the fire grows, Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from the horn, and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT. He lifts several small blades of burning grass... a miniature torch. And only then do we realize what he's about to do... because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward his gunpowder-covered throat. The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS, igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS'S NECK ON FIRE. Glass falls back to the ground in agony... TRIES TO SCREAM, but his burning, shredded vocal chords won't allow him. The gunpowder sizzles and burns... the flame spreads... Glass' flesh sears... melts. And the pain is too much for Glass... he passes out. EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT ANGLE ON GLASS... looking dead beside the river, but we know he's alive because we can hear those same painful, raspy breaths. And then we hear something else... an O.S. RATTLING, growing LOUDER... FASTER... BUZZING... until Glass' eyes flash open. CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON A RATTLESNAKE COILED INCHES FROM HIS FACE. Glass stares back in horror... has time to throw up his arm in protection as the snake STRIKES... SINKS ITS FANGS INTO HIS FOREARM. 41. He shakes it free, but can't escape the snake's next strike... locking its jaws onto Glass' burned throat. Glass opens his mouth to scream. CUT TO: EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY And Glass' eyes flying open in the glaring sun, as he awakens from his nightmare... looks to his arm... no snake. His hand instinctively jumps to his melted throat. No bites. But that's when he hears it... we all do... that same RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM. Glass slowly turns his head toward the sound... ...and there's a RATTLESNAKE COILED just a few feet away. Only it isn't poised to attack Glass. It's facing the other way, its target a FIELD MOUSE, trapped against a rock. The snake attacks, sinking its fangs into the mouse. The field mouse tumbles over... quivers as the poison runs through its body, then dies. As Glass watches the snake begin to make a meal of the mouse, his hand grips a rock. He drags himself toward the occupied snake... raises the rock high, then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE SNAKE'S HEAD. Glass immediately pulls the razor from his bag, and slices off the rattlesnake's head, the field mouse still lodged halfway inside. Glass then drags the razor down the length of the snake... digs his fingers under the fresh seam, then peels the outer layer down off the rattler. With the skin still hanging off the round tube of flesh, Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing off a chunk of meat. He gobbles it down, slowing only to painfully swallow the food past his injured throat. EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE... ...the head, skin, and not much else. GLASS - at the water's edge, drinking... touching his charred, melted throat... no leaks. He opens his Possibles bag... pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE... stares at it a beat, then slips it over his head. 42. He drags out the map... spreads it on the ground, then throws a glance around him... fingers the point on the blue line... a rough guess of his location. ANGLE ON THE MAP... ...Fort Union at the top... hundreds of miles north. Fort Brazeau south... but not nearly as far away. Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald and Bridger just ahead of him. Then he looks back down to his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. He looks to his leg... all but worthless for now... his one good arm. It's clear he's not ready to take revenge on anyone. So Glass shoves the map back into the bag... ties it around his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK, FALLEN LOG, and rolls it into the river. Glass crawls in behind it... deeper, until the current grows strong enough to carry the weight of his mangled body downstream. Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts floating... letting the river do the work. He watches the land move past him faster than it has in days... and without all the agony of every move. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Winding through the open prairie. Glass hangs onto the log... floats with the gentle current. EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING The sinking sun casts an orange glow over the water. Glass floats downstream... past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the riverbank. The animals don't even notice him. EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds. A heavy mist hangs over the river. Glass is draped across the log, eyes closed... letting the slow current carry him south. But then his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE. Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air. 43. But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog, scanning the surface. But it's gone... the water's empty... that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER. Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT WATERFALL. He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current. He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. They pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out. The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing... turning... SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK... he spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking him down the rocky gauntlet. He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps loose... Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped down another set of falls. The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river. Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. His body drifts face-down toward shore. And just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river. Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded in that mist. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... the right still pressed into the muddy bank. The sun beats down... then SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing over Glass. And then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME... ...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it... stretches it. Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing at his battered wounds. 44. Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away. He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from his throat. The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks on his flesh. Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them back. The vultures give up the battle... fly away. Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM... waiting for him to die. Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. He glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away. At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free, creating a partial cave. Glass starts crawling toward it. And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than when he started this journey. EXT. CAVE - DAY No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from predators. Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as he can... collapses against the rock wall. INT. CAVE - DAY Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile... begins sparking rocks together to build a fire. INT. CAVE - LATER The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a man-made needle and thread. Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest... piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly together... before repeating the excruciating process all over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten. 45. EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT The moon's glow reflects off the water. INT. CAVE - NIGHT ANGLE ON GLASS' HAND... ...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO THE CAVE'S ROCK WALL. WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach the fire... its flame warm and strong. We TIGHTEN ON THE FIRE, until WE'RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK... ...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash. The O.S. SCRATCHING has silenced. We glide back across the cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground. And above him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching... "Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger. If find eether kill for Hugh Glass" We hold on those words a beat, then... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface. THUNDER RUMBLES... the rain grows heavier. EXT. CAVE - NIGHT Rain pouring... gullies of water run down the ridge, spewing over the mouth of the cave. But inside, Glass doesn't stir... lying there just as we last saw him. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Rain coming down in buckets. The river's raging. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Clouds drift across the moon... the storm has ended. 46. EXT. CAVE - DAY Sunny and clear. A rabbit hops along... stops for a moment outside the cave. Beyond it, Glass is still sprawled on the cave floor... he must be dead. The rabbit continues on past. INT. CAVE - DAY TIGHT ON GLASS' FACE... as his eyes flutter open. He stares straight ahead, unmoving. EXT. CAVE - DAY Glass crawls out of the crevice... shields his eyes from the sun, as he takes in the scene. The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered and muddy. The water is thick and brown with all the flooded earth it pulled up. Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then higher... onto his healthy leg. He braces himself against a tree. He's still crooked and hunched over, but for the first time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than an animal. He bends down... picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Glass limps along the bank... beside the brown water stirred up from the flood. He moves along the washed-out area, searching for food... grabs some plants... tears them from the ground to chew on the roots. He continues on... spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in the flood, frozen on its back. Glass kneels down to pick up the turtle... sniffs it. As he does, he spots something across the river... a DEER, staring back at him. Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE... takes careful aim at the deer... pulls the trigger. If only he had his Anstadt. But then the deer's head snaps... to something beyond Glass. Glass follows the animal's eyes... turns to the ridge... and the FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS' CAVE. Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the flood. He looks back across the river... THE DEER IS LONG GONE. 47. Glass inches his head up over the tree... to the warriors now crouched outside the cave... studying the tracks. Glass' eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river... HIS FOOTPRINTS CLEAR... an obvious trail leading right to him. He throws a glance around... nowhere to run even if he could. So he starts backing into the river on his stomach... feet- first... dragging a small branch over the tracks around him, wiping them away as he moves. And his eyes are locked on the Arikara... watching to see if they spot him. But they haven't yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward... five feet off shore... only three feet deep in the murky water and sludge. But if he goes any further, the current will catch him... pull him into the next set of violent rapids... and make him a clear target. The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave. Glass sinks neck-deep into the water... the Arikara keep coming... near the river. So Glass drops beneath the surface. CUT TO: UNDERWATER - And Glass' eyes spread wide... searching the muddy water. He grabs a LARGE ROCK... rolls onto his back, and places the rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the river bottom. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS... following Glass' tracks to the edge of the river... looking out over the brown river. CUT TO: UNDERWATER - Glass pressing his head back against the bottom... staring up through the cloudy water... to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY. EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass... looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. But the surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see anything below. 48. But they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to explode from the river, gasping for air. But he doesn't... and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path. Behind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees. Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and boulders... pulling himself to the other side. EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy water of the Grand. EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. Glass claws at the ground after it. He's starving to death. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT The rain beating down through the trees. Glass huddles in a cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the cold. He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin boot standing in the rain. He pulls it in... slurps back the rainfall that it's caught. EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. He's weak... starving... isn't going to make it much further. He drops to his hands and knees. And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling under his hands. He watches his hands quiver with vibration. A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound. EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE. 49. An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind them. Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN BUFFALO. Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND SNAP over the remains. And he eyes that buffalo... the closest he's been to food in days. EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts bloody from the meal. Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads snaps up... bares its teeth... SNARLS. And then we see what the wolf is growling at... Glass... limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS clawing in the night. The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching. They growl at Glass. But Glass keeps coming... doing his best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. He swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the air. The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. But Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames... driving each wolf back. Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away... SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure what its up against. Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS' ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across the wolf's head. The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns back... makes another charge at Glass. But Glass is ready... throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it with the other. The animal's fur begins to burn. The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground, then spins to join the rest of its pack. They run a safe distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass. 50. Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground, igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming wall between him and the wolves. He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds the fallen buffalo. The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the flames. As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants... attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a starving animal that's finally found food. EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT From high above the prairie... Glass and the buffalo at the center of that glowing ring of fire. EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY The wind's gusting... bending the high golden grass over on its side. Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up to shield his face from the cold winds. He spots something in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE. Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on. EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe's village... just black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky. Glass limps through the graveyard of structures... all signs of life in this village long gone. He searches a basket... pulls out a BLANKET... wraps it around his shoulders. INT. LODGE - DAY Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge... black and empty. He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of roasted buffalo from what's left of his blanket. He starts to take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE BACK ROOM. The O.S. SHUFFLING OF FEET. Glass freezes... he isn't alone. He rises... grabs a splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway... raises the post to swing... 51. ...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room. The dog takes off around a crumbled wall. Glass follows it. INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS Glass limps across the room... turns the corner of the crumbled wall... and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an ANCIENT ARIKARA SQUAW, huddled in the corner, her bony arms outstretched in front of her in weak defense. And her eyes are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind. She CRIES OUT A CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this stranger to kill her. Glass stands frozen... confused. He tries to speak, but his throat still won't let him. He crouches down in front of the old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away. He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and bones... she's obviously dying. He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes it into the squaw's hand. She immediately jerks it to her mouth... and that's when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH... she can't eat. Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor. EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream. The dog scurries out behind him... follows Glass to the water. INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY The pot boils over burning logs. Glass dips a cup in, pulling out a warm broth. He carries it to the squaw, still sitting in the corner... takes her hand, placing the cup in it for her. She gulps the liquid back. Glass goes back to refill the cup. The old woman MUMBLES SOMETHING we can't understand... over and over, as Glass brings the cup back to her. He tries to ease it into her hand, but the woman pushes it away... slides her hand up Glass' arm to his face... patting it... MUMBLING THOSE SAME WORDS... thanking Glass. 52. EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge. The puppy trails behind him, biting at one of the corners... hanging on as Glass pulls him across the dirt. INT. LODGE - EVENING Glass enters the back room with the blankets... stops when he sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes frozen open in a lifeless stare. EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at the edge of the village. The squaw lies atop the pyre, covered in the blankets he gathered for her. Glass stands beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand. The puppy rests at his feet. EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass light the pyre... the flames rise into the night. EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass crouches... pets the dog, as he watches the flames spread... engulf the woman. ANGLE ON THE GLOWING EMBERS... ...floating into the night. Beyond the sparks, we see something else... THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE VILLAGE... FAST. And now Glass sees them too... knows it's too late to run, so he just stands there. But the dog's seen enough... darts away. Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we've seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass knows it. The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass. The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30's), poised and strong, points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass. 53. Glass tries to answer... can't... touches his scarred throat. Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. The other two warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same... close in on Glass. Glass stands firm. Spotted Horse says something else to him. Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from his sides... no weapons. Spotted Horse studies Glass hard... reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass' cheek, almost testing to see if the color comes off. One of the other warriors pats Glass' hair... smiles... says something to the others. Spotted Horse and the other warrior join him, each touching Glass' hair. Then Spotted Horse spots Glass' necklace... the grizzly claw hanging from it. He examines the enormous claw, then nods to Glass' stitching and scars. SPOTTED HORSE Griz-lee. Glass hears the familiar word... nods. Three Feathers pulls a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck... holds it up to Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. Glass is confused... holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. But Three Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted Horse walks around behind Glass... raises the knife... Glass GROWLS A PLEA... but Spotted Horse slices the knife down Glass' back... just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a MASS OF WHITE WORMS... MAGGOTS... COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON GLASS' BACK. The three warriors exchange glances... they've obviously never seen anything like this. Glass sees their reaction... throws a nervous glance... what? Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. As Glass' eyes widen in panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against Glass' head. Glass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass tumbles unconscious to the dirt. Spotted Horse says something to the others... they grab Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses. 54. EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night sky. Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various tee-pees and lodges. SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other riders splash across the stream. The warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over the back of Three Feather's horse. The children race to them. ANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking... trying to focus. CUT TO: GLASS' POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE... ...to the children's eager faces swarming around him... studying this strange face. Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they back away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders. Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human figures circling the sun. An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. He eyes Glass, as Three Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside. Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING. CUT TO: A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN'S V.O. CHANTING... LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS' WRISTS AND ANKLES... stretched tight. Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee, his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in the ground. The white worms cover his back. 55. The Medicine Man... CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the air. A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man's twisted hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the steaming mixture. The liquid POURING OVER GLASS' BACK. GLASS' FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain. He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY. MORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic... A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down. HANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass' neck... chest. The Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined with RATTLESNAKE TAILS. The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the images of the buffalo and dancing shapes. Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass' mouth. The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE... lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass' throat. GLASS' EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head. AND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark. EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY Cutting through the open prairie. Snow-covered peaks touch the sky in the distance. Fitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie, dressed in furs. They rise up a steep slope... reach the top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive thirty-foot tall wooden fence. Fort Union. Bridger smiles... relieved. FITZGERALD `Bout goddamn time. They start down the slope. Fitzgerald grabs Bridger's arm... firmly. 56. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And we're understood on everything... Glass' dyin' in his sleep... us buryin' him like was agreed. Bridger doesn't respond. Fitzgerald doesn't like that. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You're as guilty as me in leavin' him. Don't you forget that. You got a future up here. No sense tossin' it away when he was as good as dead already. Shit, all we did was skip the funeral. Bridger pulls his arm free... continues on. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I won't take to givin' up that two- hundred on accounta you gettin' weak-kneed. Bridger keeps walking. Fitzgerald follows behind. INT. FORT UNION - DAY Like a small town surrounded by a log wall. The main TRADING POST BUILDING is busy... TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to trade. But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next door... crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy in the whores' rooms upstairs. A small village of tents rests off to the side of the buildings, holding the overflow of traffic. INT. SALOON - DAY Fitzgerald and Bridger enter the crowded room... squeeze their way to the bar. FITZGERALD Twice the folks here than when we left. BRIDGER We should go see Captain Henry. FITZGERALD Far as we hiked... we got time for a drink on the company's tab. 57. PIG (O.S.) Jim! They spin... see Pig, Murphy and Stubby Bill sitting at a table. Pig scrambles up... rushes to Bridger, locking him in a big bear hug. PIG (CONT'D) You made it! I was scared the `Ree mighta caught up to ya. FITZGERALD If your fat ass could get through, we didn't have no worries. Pig glares at Fitzgerald... watches him walk to the table, joining the others. PIG (off Fitzgerald, to BRIDGER) Had to be a helluva long walk for you. Bridger nods... Pig has no idea. PIG (CONT'D) Hugh? Bridger hesitates a beat, then just shakes his head. PIG (CONT'D) Guess we all knowed how it would turn out. Did he suffer much more? Another long beat, then... BRIDGER I hope not. A PROSTITUTE walks down the stairs... stops on the landing, waiting for her next customer. Fitzgerald spots her... grins. FITZGERALD (TO BRIDGER) Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. I just got a itch to spend the first of my two-hundred. The other men laugh. Not Bridger. 58. INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY Henry sits at his desk. Fitzgerald and Bridger stand across from him. The others... Pig, Anderson, Murphy, and Stubby Bill crowd the room behind them. FITZGERALD I won't pretend to been his friend, but I respect any man that fights the way he done. HENRY And the grave? FITZGERALD We had those extra days so we went deeper... covered it in rocks. To keep the scavengers off him. HENRY Any sign of hostiles? FITZGERALD Not a one. The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger. He can't take the pain... opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald beats him to it. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Truth is, I was worried `bout `Ree, and ready to get movin', but Bridger here argued to stay and make a cross for the grave. Bridger's head snaps to Fitzgerald... don't make this worse. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that's what we did. Pig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back. But to Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade. HENRY Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you would. FITZGERALD More than his share, Captain. 59. And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. Bridger drops his eyes to his feet. HENRY Speaking of shares. Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination, then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open... ...revealing STACKS OF CASH. Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a handful... starts counting them out onto the desk. HENRY (CONT'D) Am I to assume the agreed arrangement didn't change? FITZGERALD Fortunate for me, it did not. HENRY Well thank you both for your courage and honor. You have done yourselves proud. Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger. HENRY (CONT'D) You're owed something for what you did. Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have to look someone in the eye. FITZGERALD He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more. HENRY We all saw the shape Glass was in. There was no more to be done. FITZGERALD That's what I been tellin' him. 60. INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, squeezing those crumpled bills in his hand, crying. DISSOLVE TO: INT. TEE-PEE - DAY Glass sleeps under a buffalo robe. His eyes flicker open. CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE. GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. It looks much better than we last saw. And the stitches are gone from his face, now just long, pink scars. He stiffly raises himself up... remembers his back... struggles to reach behind him... scarred but clean... no maggots. He looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting on the ground... waiting for him. EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY ANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and shielding his eyes. He looks like a man that hasn't seen the light of day for weeks. Glass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the scene. And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow. The Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs. A WOMEN'S O.S. VOICE turns Glass... ...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him, bundled in fur. She says something else we can't understand... points to Glass' feet. Glass looks down... to his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW. He hadn't noticed. And then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile. She takes his hand... leads him back into the tee-pee. 61. INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS Glass and Waki enter. She pulls a pair of moccasins from a basket... hands them to Glass. He slips them on, then presses his fingers against his throat... almost trying to hold it all inside to make it work, then... GLASS (scratching and rough) Thank you. Waki doesn't understand... just raises a cup of liquid... says something, then touches his throat... motions for him to drink. Glass sips the drink... grimaces... shakes his head, trying to give the cup back, but Waki refuses... points at his throat, and motions for him to drink. Glass stares in the cup a beat, then gulps it back... shakes his head. GLASS (CONT'D) Bad medicine. Waki smiles... hands him his BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass nods in thanks, then achingly lifts his arms up to slip it over his head. GLASS (CONT'D) How long have I been here? Waki just stares back... no idea what Glass said. GLASS (CONT'D) You're Sioux. I only know a bit a Pawnee. Glass stumbles through a sentence of Pawnee. Waki shakes her head... throws a jumble of Sioux back at him. GLASS (CONT'D) The snow... my healin'. (points to himself) Me. (points to the ground) Here. How long? Waki shakes her head again. Glass leads her outside. 62. EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS Glass points to the sun overhead, then raises both hands, fingers outstretched. GLASS How many suns? Ten? Waki studies Glass... the sun... begins to understand. She nods... SAYS A WORD... holds up all ten of her fingers. GLASS (CONT'D) Ten suns? Then Waki closes her hands into fists... opens them again... closes them again... SAYS A DIFFERENT WORD. GLASS (CONT'D) Christ. Glass glances around... for the first time, notices Sioux MEN and WOMEN staring at him. Children freeze in the middle of their play... all eyes locked on Glass. TWO SMALL BOYS, (NEW MOON and LITTLE ONE), repeat the same TWO WORDS to each other... BOYS Tatanka Wicasa. ...over and over. Glass stares back, unsure. Then... SPOTTED HORSE (O.S.) Buff-A-lo Man. Glass turns... sees Yellow Horse stepping out of a tee-pee. Spotted Horse (cont'd) (very broken english) What they call you. (points to Glass' hair) Fur of Buff-A-lo. Glass touches his hair... nods... smiles. The children smile and laugh now too... repeat the words LOUDER. GLASS You speak English. SPOTTED HORSE Need words when trade with whites. 63. GLASS Well I'm grateful for you bringing me here... havin' them care for me. (off Spotted Horse's nod) Now if you could point me which way it is you do your tradin'... with the whites. SPOTTED HORSE (POINTS) Whites. Bra-zo. GLASS Fort Brazeau? That's where I'm tryin' to get. Is it far from here? Spotted Horse doesn't understand. Glass motions into the distance. GLASS (CONT'D) Far? Long way? Spotted Horse points to a horse, then holds up three fingers. GLASS (CONT'D) Three days on horse? Spotted Horse nods... looks Glass over, and shakes his head. SPOTTED HORSE Not walk. Hides soon. Glass doesn't understand... until Spotted Horse points to a ROW OF BUFFALO HIDES hanging from a line. Spotted Horse (cont'd) We trade Bra-zo. Glass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg. Finally, he nods. Spotted Horse starts walking... waves for Glass to follow. Spotted Horse (cont'd) Come. Eat. Glass follows after him. The children sneak in behind, giggling as they tail Glass across camp. Glass glances back... New Moon and Little One duck behind a tee-pee... wait for him to continue before they scoot back out after him. 64. INT. CHIEF'S LODGE - NIGHT Glass, Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS. GLASS The men stole my rifle. The Sioux don't understand. Glass reaches over, taking Spotted Horse's plate. GLASS (CONT'D) They took. They took... Glass aims an imaginary rifle. GLASS (CONT'D) ...my rifle. My gear. Now Spotted Horse understands... translates for the others. GLASS (CONT'D) They left me to die. So I mean to find `em both. Get my rifle back. Spotted Horse translates again. Red Hawk nods, studying Glass. Red Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass... motions to the BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass looks to Spotted Horse. SPOTTED HORSE Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee. Glass touches his chest. Red Hawk nods, impressed. Glass points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk's neck to a MISSING RIGHT EAR. GLASS Grizzly? Red Hawk smiles... shakes his head. RED HAWK Arikara. That word, Glass understands. Red Hawk rambles a long sentence in Sioux. The other members LAUGH. 65. SPOTTED HORSE He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you. Glass smiles along with the others. They continue their meal. EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY Snow falls over Glass, as he stands outside the tee-pee, flexing his injured leg... putting more weight on it... testing its recovered strength. Suddenly, a SPEAR PLANTS INTO THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS FEET. Glass turns, startled... sees Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox, and several OTHER WARRIORS staring at him. Glass' eyes jump from the spear to the warriors, unsure. Spotted Horse strides to Glass... grabs the spear, then spins it sideways... stares at Glass, until a smile spreads across Spotted Horse's face... he holds the spear out to Glass. SPOTTED HORSE Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux? Glass relaxes... nods... takes the spear from Spotted Horse. Three Feathers hands a BUFFALO HIDE to Glass... motions for Glass to put it on. THREE FEATHERS Tatanka Wicasa. Glass wraps the hide around him. The Warriors smile and nod. EXT. FOREST - DAY A world of silent white... like we're inside a giant snow- globe. The sky is emptying all the snow it has over us... pouring down... the only sound comes from the flakes hitting the already fallen snow. The pale trunks of Cottonwoods rise up from the white ground. Then out of the white... a SHAPE APPEARS... a GIANT WOLF WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS. But as the wolf comes closer, we see it's not a wolf at all... it's THREE FEATHERS, wearing his WOLF SKIN. He CRIES OUT... HOWLING WILDLY. A few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same... CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he walks. 66. GLASS - WEARING THE BUFFALO HIDE... ...walking slowly through the trees, carrying the spear. Yellow Bear is beside him... motions for Glass to spread out. FROM ABOVE THE TREES... ...we see the fur-covered warriors are formed into a wide circle... and slowly converging... YELLING... pounding their spears... making as much noise as possible, as they tighten their ring. POV FROM THE BRUSH... ...watching DISTANT CHANTING WARRIORS pushing through the trees. V.O. SNORTING... our POV darts sideways... charges through the brush... slides to a stop when we see Running Fox moving toward us... spins back another direction. GLASS - MOVING THROUGH THE FOREST... ...the falling snow clinging to his face... covering the buffalo hide. And then a MASSIVE SHAPE BLASTS through the trees ahead of him. Glass freezes, his grip tightening on the spear. He looks to Spotted Horse, who nods... YELLS OUT, beating his spear against the trees, and motioning for Glass to do the same. Glass is apprehensive at first... just lightly tapping his spear. But as the other warriors' chants grow, Glass gets caught up in the hunt... begins beating the trees... YELLING as loud as his throat will allow. THE WARRIORS - EYES PIERCING THROUGH THE SNOW... CHANTING... BEATING THE BUSHES. OUR LOW POV AGAIN - RACING CHAOTICALLY THROUGH THE BRUSH... ...to Spotted Horse waving his spear... back over the snow... to Three Feathers SCREAMING... we spin again... crash through bushes, then suddenly TUMBLE... DROP THROUGH THE SNOW. 67. GLASS - HEARING THE ANIMAL'S WAIL... ...seeing Spotted Horse pick up his pace... start trotting forward. Glass does the same... all the hunters converging around a LARGE BLACK HOLE IN THE SNOW... ...and the ELK trapped at the bottom. The warriors cry out victoriously... begin DRIVING THEIR SPEARS INTO THE TRAP, killing the animal. EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - EVENING The elk roasts over a fire at the center of the village. Glass sits alone outside the tee-pee, using the sharp tip of the spear to carve into a small chunk of wood. As he carves, New Moon and Little One sneak around the tee- pee behind him... watch Glass work. Glass hears them GIGGLING... doesn't react... just keeps carving... tilts the long handle of the spear as he works, tapping the side of the tee-pee, and SHAKING LOOSE A CLUMP OF SNOW DOWN ONTO THE BOYS. The shocked boys freeze in the cold... wipe the snow from their faces to see Glass grinning at them. The little boys charge Glass, leaping onto him... wrestling him to the ground, as they squeeze his hair. BOYS Tatanka Wicasa! Tatanka Wicasa! Spotted Horse stands across the village, watching Glass and the boys play in the snow. EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass stands at the edge of the village, carving at the wood with the spear tip, and watching the Sioux from a distance. Yellow Bear sees him... approaches, carrying his SON on his shoulders. The little boy gnaws on a strip of meat. Spotted Horse holds out a bowl of food to Glass. GLASS Thank you. SPOTTED HORSE Good hunt. 68. GLASS Yes. Glass smiles up at Spotted Horse's son. SPOTTED HORSE You. Fam-i-lee? GLASS (shakes his head) No. SPOTTED HORSE No wom-an? (pointing to son) Wakayaja? A long beat, then... GLASS No. Not for a long time. Glass continues eating... watches Spotted Horse bounce the giggling little boy on his shoulders. EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY Glass steps out of his tee-pee, whittling with the spear tip. He glances up... freezes because he sees several Sioux pulling the hides from the line... rolling them up to carry. Spotted Horse (O.S.) Bra-zo. Glass turns to Spotted Horse, pointing to the hides. Glass nods... looks back to the last of the hides being pulled down... doesn't seem as excited as he once might have been. EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - LATER Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit atop their horses. Three Feathers holds the reins to another horse packed with hides. An empty horse stands beside them... waiting for Glass. Glass is leaning over to New Moon and Little One... handing them the CRUDE BUFFALO CARVING he made from the wood. GLASS (taps his chest) Tatanka Wicasa. 69. The little boys smile. Glass nods to Waki, then waves to Red Hawk and the Medicine Man. They return it... watch Glass climb onto his horse. Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride out of the village. EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride along a high ridge, surrounded by empty snow-covered wilderness. They have the world to themselves. EXT. CAMP - NIGHT Glass crouches over a shallow, five-foot long hole surrounded by deep snow. The hole is filled with small fires and rocks. And he's watching Spotted Horse and Three Feathers tossing rocks into their own matching holes, then dragging the dirt back into them. Spotted Horse throws a glance back to Glass, making sure he understands. Glass nods... pulls the dirt back in, covering the flames. He watches Spotted Horse spread a blanket over the warm ground, then does the same. He sits on the mound of dirt... leans back against a tree... feels the warmth rise up from beneath him. He nods to Spotted Horse, who is already resting under his blanket. GLASS Nice. SPOTTED HORSE (NODS) Nice. Glass pulls the buffalo hide around himself... keeping watch. SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Sleep. No Arikara. Glass nods... but still doesn't close his eyes. Spotted Horse tosses his knife over beside Glass. Glass takes it... nods to Spotted Horse. SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Me sleep. 70. Spotted Horse rolls over, turning his back on Glass... trusting him with the knife. Three Feathers does the same. Glass just stares out into the night. INT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT Dark and quiet... except for the SNORING of a few men. Fitzgerald sleeps on his cot. A shadow glides across him... hovers over his face. Fitzgerald's eyes blink open. CUT TO: FITZGERALD'S POV... ...on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM... his scarred face calm and deadly... raising a knife to drive down into Fitzgerald's chest. FITZGERALD No... please. But Glass swings the blade. CUT TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING And Spotted Horse shaking Glass awake from his dream. Glass' hand flies up, the knife gripped. But Spotted Horse grabs his arm... stops it in mid-swing... holds it until Glass realizes it was a dream... relaxes. SPOTTED HORSE We go. Glass calms... nods. EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - DAY Just a small cluster of log buildings sitting along the banks of the Missouri. Dozens of tee-pees and tents are set up outside the complex. Glass follows Spotted Horse and Three Feathers into the camp. BEGGING INDIANS and DRUNK TRAPPERS paw at the men as they ride past, pleading for handouts. 71. One of the Indians grabs for the hides. Three Feathers plants his foot in the Indian's chest... shoves him back into the snow. They continue on... climb off their horses outside the TRADING POST. Three Feathers stays to guard the hides, as Spotted Horse and Glass enter. INT. TRADING POST - DAY A small, dingy room lined with shelves, all stacked high with pots, pans, dry goods, whiskey, blankets, weapons... anything that can be traded. KIOWA BRAZEAU, (60's), French-Canadian, stands behind the counter... looks up when the BELL over the door RINGS... sees Spotted Horse with Glass behind. BRAZEAU (thick French accent) Bon jour, Spotted Horse. You come with many hides I hope. (off Spotted Horse's nod) We make good trades then. Brazeau's eyes lock on Glass... stares at him, unsure. BRAZEAU (CONT'D) Monsieur Glass? GLASS Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau. BRAZEAU Jesus Christ, what happened to your goddamned face? GLASS Had a tussle with a grizzly. Glass shakes Brazeau's hand. Brazeau studies his face... notices the Bear Claw Necklace... smiles. BRAZEAU And now the grizzly, he don't look so good either, eh? Glass shakes his head. BRAZEAU (CONT'D) (off Spotted Horse) You run with the Sioux these days? 72. GLASS They looked after me for a spell. I'm on my way to catch back up with Captain Henry... at Fort Union. Needed to trade for some supplies on the Company's credit if I could. BRAZEAU Oui, of course. Anything you like. Glass pulls down a KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE. GLASS We can start with this. INT. TRADING POST - LATER Glass is loaded with gear. He signs a ticket for Brazeau. BRAZEAU You can pick up the horse at the livery in the morning. (off Glass' nod) I wish I could give you a room for the night, but... Brazeau looks to SEVERAL TRAPPERS standing across the room, glaring at Glass. BRAZEAU (CONT'D) I cannot risk the trouble of letting a colored stay inside. Glass glances to the trappers... one of them spits in Glass' direction... makes some MONKEY SOUNDS... daring Glass to respond. Glass just turns away. GLASS Won't be the last night I sleep on the ground. Glass nods to Brazeau, then walks out. BRAZEAU Take care of that face, Glass. EXT. TRADING POST - DAY Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit on their horses. The other horses are now packed with new goods. Glass approaches. 73. GLASS (points to the tents) You stay here tonight? Spotted Horse shakes his head... motions back toward the wilderness. Then he points to the trading post... the TRAPPERS. SPOTTED HORSE Your people? Glass looks back to all the white faces... trappers, drunks, prostitutes. He shakes his head. GLASS No. SPOTTED HORSE You come then. Spotted Horse taps his own chest... points back the way they came. Glass hesitates, almost like he's considering it... then he shakes his head again... points the opposite way. GLASS Fort Union. Spotted Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then... SPOTTED HORSE You spend your life hunting enemy. Enemy wins. GLASS It will be over soon. Then Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off... hands it to Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse holds it... then proudly slides it over his head. GLASS (CONT'D) (IN SIOUX) Thank you. Spotted Horse raises his hand in goodbye, then spins his horse and starts away. Three Feathers does the same. Glass returns it... watches them ride off. EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - NIGHT Glass is in the trees beyond the tents and tee-pees... crouched on the ground... 74. dragging the dirt back over the fire and rocks. He slides up onto the mound... feels the warmth, and smiles... just a little. EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - MORNING Glass rides a PAINT MARE along a ridge overlooking the river. Fort Brazeau stands in the distance behind him. EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY Snowy and cold. Glass leads the line of riders through the snow. EXT. FORT UNION - EVENING But you can't tell if it's day or night through the blizzard. Fitzgerald, Pig, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe trudge through the snow in their snowshoes... finally reach the bunkhouse. INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind... latches it. The men look worn and battered... wind-burnt faces, icicles in their beards. FITZGERALD I had enough of this cold as hell shit. ANDERSON What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? That you was headin' off to paradise? Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense. FITZGERALD I tell ya what I figured, I figured I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't freeze before I got it outta my pecker. BRIDGER Figured wrong. 75. Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but Bridger's returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald decides he'd better not push it. FITZGERALD Waste a time to check traps in this weather... while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office. STUBBY BILL Why don't you go tell him that, Fitz? Then start your hike back to St. Louie. FITZGERALD Shit, I walked up here, I got no problem walkin' back. MURPHY Contracted for twelve months. We all did. FITZGERALD Henry can shove that contract up his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it for him. The others laugh at Fitzgerald's rambling. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You don't think I will? The men shake their heads. Fitzgerald grabs his gloves... starts strapping his snowshoes back on. ANDERSON Just give that fat little whore you're so sweet on a couple extra bits... she'll have you thinkin' it's Spring already. The men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out... leaves the door wide open for the cold wind to pour over the others. Pig scurries over, shoving it closed. As the other men gather around a table to play cards, Bridger pulls a JOURNAL from under his cot... falls onto the cot, and starts writing. INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - EVENING Fitzgerald enters... looks around the empty office. 76. FITZGERALD Hello? Captain? The place is empty. Fitzgerald eyes Henry's desk... then past his desk... to the SAFE... its door CRACKED OPEN... STACKS OF MONEY visible inside. Fitzgerald glances around... looks back to that safe. EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT Dark and quiet. The snow has stopped. INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT Fitzgerald eases up from his cot... looks around at the sleeping men. EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT Fitzgerald slips out of the bunkhouse door... across the compound... toward the front gate. MURPHY (O.S.) Where're you headed? Fitzgerald looks up... sees Murphy in the Blockhouse on sentry duty. FITZGERALD To the river, Murphy. Murphy squints down into the shadows. MURPHY That you, Fitzgerald? FITZGERALD Left my rifle down there... don't want it out all night. MURPHY That weren't too smart. FITZGERALD Just don't take a shot at me when I come back in. MURPHY We'll see. 77. Murphy waves Fitzgerald out. FITZGERALD Not that you'd hit me if you tried. Murphy fakes a laugh... raises his rifle down at Fitzgerald. CUT TO: POV DOWN MURPHY'S RIFLE... ...on Fitzgerald moving toward the river... disappearing into the darkness. EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - NIGHT Out of sight from the fort. Fitzgerald slides the ANSTADT FROM UNDER HIS COAT... hurries down the bank... searches under the brush and snow... pulls out an OVERTURNED CANOE. He drags it to the icy edge... slides it across the ice toward the middle of the river, where the water still hasn't frozen over. The ice CRACKS UNDER HIS FEET. Fitzgerald climbs in the canoe... pounds the ice with the oar, breaking it loose. The current seeps through the cracks... catches the canoe, pulling it to the center of the wide river... sends Fitzgerald shooting south. He throws a glance back at the shadow of Fort Union in the distance... growing smaller. EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Clear blue sky. The sun glistening off the snow-covered ground. Glass is bundled under furs, as he rides through the snowy trees. EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Tucked under the rooftop of trees. A small fire burns. Glass sits on his fire-bed, looking over a map. An O.S. SNORT from the Paint Mare, tied to a tree. Glass looks over in time to see the horse's ears perk up. With his eyes searching the darkness, Glass slowly reaches over... grabs his rifle. Then he drops to his stomach... slides backward into the brush. 78. Glass peers through the brush... the woods seem empty... until SEVERAL DARK SHAPES APPEAR... moving through the distant trees... coming straight toward Glass' camp. Then an O.S. SNAP BEHIND GLASS... he glances back in time to see an ARIKARA WARRIOR SWINGING A HATCHET. Glass spins his rifle... shoves it into the stomach of the Warrior as he swings... BOOM... the Warrior flies back. The dark woods suddenly ERUPT IN WAR CRIES... Arikara appear from all sides... charge toward the camp. Glass scrambles up... races toward the Paint Mare as ARROWS AND GUNSHOTS FLASH THROUGH THE AIR ALL AROUND HIM. Glass swings up onto the Paint Mare... spots ELK'S TONGUE leading the charge... the necklace of ears hanging around his neck. And Elk's Tongue's eyes are locked on Glass... almost like he remembers him. Glass takes off through the forest. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the trees... the animal's nostrils spread wide, pulling in all the oxygen it can. Glass glances back... sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM... HORSES... ridden by Elk's Tongue and eight other warriors. Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in front of him, and realizing it isn't a clearing at all... ...it's the edge of the world. The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of ground... because she's just galloped off the side of a cliff. The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its legs flailing for something to stand on. Glass drops the rifle to grip the horse's mane, hanging on for what seems an endless fall. 79. The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still on her back. The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she drops into the snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her. CUT TO: EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS And the horse comes crashing through the branches... the massive limbs slowing her fall... snapping off as her body hits and twists... tosses Glass away. The Paint Mare continues her deadly descent, the trees tearing at her body... catching her head... SNAPPING her neck. Glass slams off a branch... tumbles to the ground with a thud. The Paint Mare hits the snow beside him... very dead. Glass struggles to breath... finally GASPS... sucks in the oxygen. He lays there a moment... stares up through the trees... ...to Elk's Tongue and the others staring down from the top of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass. Glass rises to his knees... glances around for his rifle... lost. He flinches with what must be broken ribs... drags himself up, and staggers to the horse... pulls his knife and cuts the snowshoes from the back of the saddle. He throws the snowshoes over his shoulder... continues on, through the woods... alone... in the middle of nowhere... again. EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY From high above... the small shape of Glass making his way over the snowy ground... heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS. EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri. Two ramshackle structures... the General Store and a tattered livery stable filled with horses. 80. INT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY More like a saloon that sells a few supplies. A gang of TRAPPERS drink and play cards. A RUNTY MAN stands behind the counter, watching them... ...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. He pulls the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is... scarred face stiff from the cold... ice frozen in his beard. The room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. Until TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh. Glass limps to the counter. All eyes follow him. GLASS (struggling to make his frozen lips move) I'm Hugh Glass of... RUNTY MAN We don't serve niggers. Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then... GLASS Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on my way to Fort Union. RUNTY MAN I don't care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. We don't serve niggers. GLASS All I need is a horse and enough supplies to... TRAPPER Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause he ain't listenin' to you, Cees. GLASS ...to get me to Fort Union. I can sign a draft made good by Captain Henry. The Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN. RUNTY MAN What the fuck happened to your face, boy? You try to slice all the black off? 81. TRAPPER #2 Maybe we oughta help him do it right. FAT TRAPPER Best get on your way, boy. Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then... GLASS I'm Hugh Glass of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and all I need is... RUNTY MAN (to the trappers) Do you believe this shit? Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their belts... start toward Glass. FAT TRAPPER Hell, I warned ya. GLASS All I need... And that's when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass, but in a flash of movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1's CHIN. Everyone freezes. GLASS (CONT'D) ...is a horse and enough supplies to get me to Fort Union. Then Glass slides Trapper #1's PISTOL from his belt... aims it at the other men. GLASS (CONT'D) And this shooter here. All made good by Captain Henry and The Rocky Mountain Fur Company. EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY The snow pours down on the Runty Man and the trappers, as they stand outside, rifles aimed into the distance. RUNTY MAN Shoot him, goddammit! 82. TRAPPER #2 I can't get a clear look. RUNTY MAN Shoot `em both! The Runty Man snatches one of the rifles... BOOM... fires a wild shot past the riders. CUT TO: GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK... ...with Trapper #1 sitting backward on the horse behind him. Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs, and keeps glancing back to the men growing smaller behind him. Finally, Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse. Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow. The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS... too far away to reach Glass, who just keeps racing north. CUT TO: THE RUNTY MAN - WATCHING GLASS ESCAPE. RUNTY MAN Get after the son of a bitch! The trappers exchange glances... don't move. TRAPPER #2 It's cold as hell, Cees. FAT TRAPPER And he did say to put it all on the Rocky Mountain tab. The Runty Man glares at the trappers. EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - EVENING Glass riding the horse at a trot through the snow. EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT Thick with fog, and silent as death. The moon fights its way through the mist, sending an eerie glow over the fort. 83. EXT. FORT UNION/BLOCKHOUSE - NIGHT Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair, his rifle across his lap. O.S. CRUNCHING... getting louder... loud enough to nudge Stubby Bill awake. He sits up... peers over the wall, but can't see anything in the fog... just hears the CRUNCHING MOVING CLOSER... FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW. CUT TO: STUBBY BILL'S POV... ...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... a FIGURE walking... leading a horse behind him... appearing out of the mist like a ghost... GLASS. STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK... ...sure his eyes are betraying him. But then Glass looks straight up at Stubby Bill, and there's no doubt. STUBBY BILL Jesus Christ. INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT Dark and quiet... just Pig's snoring rattling the silence. Suddenly the door kicks open... SLAMS into the wall... and there's GLASS' SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY. GROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room's fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes floating across the room, searching for a target. The men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the same dream. Except for Bridger, who's propped up in his cot like he's been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to appear in that doorway. BRIDGER I'm sorry. Glass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger. And the young man doesn't flinch... almost as if he wants to make sure Glass doesn't miss. 84. The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell's going on. Glass holds his aim on Bridger's face... a face that's haunted him... kept him alive. GLASS You took everything I had... left me to die. Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an executioner's drum. MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down. GLASS (CONT'D) Why? BRIDGER I was scared of dyin'. (BEAT) But every day since, I've wished I had. Glass' finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make Bridger's wish come true. The rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide- eyed, stone silence, afraid to move. GLASS There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there? A long beat, then... BRIDGER No. Glass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. And before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him... those aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger. And Bridger doesn't fight back... just does his best to cover up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered in blood... ...just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby Bill awoke him. Henry grabs Glass... pulls him off. Glass spins... jams his pistol right in Henry's face. 85. HENRY Hugh. Wait. Glass is crazy with rage... barely stops himself from pulling that trigger. But finally, he calms... his arm sinks, lowering his aim. He glances around the bunkhouse. GLASS Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle? HENRY Deserted two days ago. Along with about five hundred dollars of company money. (BEAT) Let's get some coffee to warm you up. (to Glass, but looking at BRIDGER) I wanna hear what happened. Glass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until Glass walks out. BRIDGER Wait. Please! But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all those eyes burning into him. Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig just lowers his eyes... can't even look at the boy. The men step into their boots and furs... file out after Glass and Henry... leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse. INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT Glass sits by the warmth of the stove, sipping coffee. Henry's behind he desk, with the other men scattered around. GLASS I cut the shoes loose of her, and hiked over to Fort Talbot. STUBBY BILL Christ almighty. GLASS And you may hear from the fella there about a stoled horse and supplies charged to you. 86. HENRY We'll take care of it. You should go settle in. MURPHY There's a couple fair whores next door that'll ease the miles on ya, scars or not. Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow. ANDERSON Jesus, Murph. MURPHY I just meant I'd go roust one of `em for ya if you wanted. GLASS She can take the night off, but I wouldn't mind the use of her bed. HENRY (TO MURPHY) Go clear out a room. The rest head on back to bunk. Murphy hustles out. The others move toward the door, each stopping to shake Glass' hand, or give him a pat on the back. PIG I told ya I'd see ya up here. You remember that, Hugh? GLASS I do, Pig. You must have a little gypsy in ya. Pig grins and nods. PIG I'll see ya in the mornin'. Pig exits, leaving just Glass and Henry, sitting in a beat of silence, until... HENRY Can I talk you outta what you're planning? Glass doesn't answer... just stands, placing the coffee cup on the table. 87. GLASS Thank you for what you done for me... stitchin' me back together... givin' me a chance. HENRY I'm offerin' you another right now... to stay here... let this thing go. GLASS (BEAT) He thinks he let me die. But he don't know that he's the one that's kept me alive... for the chance of findin' him... makin' him pay for what he done. HENRY The law will make Fitzgerald pay. Glass stares out the window... his SCARRED REFLECTION stares back at him. GLASS You told me once that other men didn't think like him. (BEAT) But the truth is, most do. I seen it my whole life... the looks folks give... the whisperin'. I watched my wife and son die from the fever on accounta no white doctor would care for `em. Wasn't no different to them than if their neighbor's dog was sick. (BEAT) So I don't figure nobody's gonna care much that Fitzgerald took some dyin' nigger's rifle, and left him in the middle of nowhere. (turns to Henry) Do you, Captain? Henry doesn't answer... because he knows Glass is right. GLASS (CONT'D) I thank you for the coffee. Glass walks out. Henry just sits there. 88. EXT. FORT UNION - DAY Glass, Pig and Murphy stand by Glass' horse, as he ties off his supplies. MURPHY He said he was goin' to get his rifle... And then Murphy catches himself... shrugs. MURPHY (CONT'D) Your rifle. But he never showed back up. The next day I figured him mighta fell in, but then Pig seen the canoe was missin'. PIG And the Captain found the money gone. GLASS I'll make my way down river. See what turns up. Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse. Stubby Bill comes waddling toward them. STUBBY BILL The kid's gone... gear and all. Musta slipped out before light. Stubby Bill waves Bridger's journal at them. STUBBY BILL (cont'd) Just left this on his bunk. Henry takes the journal... flips it open. HENRY (READING) "Every day I think about what I done. I want to tell Pig and the others the truth but am afraid what they'll think of me. I look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but am afraid to try. I am a coward and wish he hadn't been lyin about the Ree that night. I wish they had come and kilt us both." Glass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse. 89. GLASS If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way. Glass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them. GLASS (CONT'D) Where're you headed? HENRY Fitzgerald stole five hundred dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too. GLASS I can do this on my own. HENRY I know you can. But maybe you won't have to. Glass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his horse around... heads for the river. Henry nods to Pig and Murphy as he follows after Glass. EXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY From above Fort Union. Our POV on Glass and Henry riding south along the icy river. And then we see our POV is Bridger's... standing along the ledge, loaded with all his gear. He watches the riders another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction... leaving Fort Union behind forever. EXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY The Runty Man behind the counter. A few of the same Trappers drinking... playing cards. Just another day at Fort Talbot. The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters. RUNTY MAN We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for. The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald... cold and miserable. 90. FITZGERALD Then what the hell have ya got? RUNTY MAN Whiskey and blankets mostly. Weather's held back deliveries. Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers. FITZGERALD Gimme a couple bottles then. Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been walkin' for two days. The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. Fitzgerald pops one... gulps some down. FITZGERALD (CONT'D) How much for one of them horses out there? RUNTY MAN Horses ain't cheap this time a year. FITZGERALD Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it. And those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald. RUNTY MAN You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. And the first one left a bad taste. FITZGERALD That right? Well I don't know nothin' about that. Just that I need a horse. RUNTY MAN So did this other fella. So he stole one... along with Lange's pistola. Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald. FITZGERALD Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. How much? 91. RUNTY MAN How `bout you pay for your friend's too. TRAPPER #1 And my shooter. FITZGERALD Wasn't my friend. Trapper #1 stands up. TRAPPER #1 Then from where I stand, you don't got no friends at all. The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald. The Runty Man just grins that toothless smile of his. Fitzgerald's in a bind, and he knows it. FITZGERALD Yeah, okay. I'll collect from him. How much? RUNTY MAN How `bout we say eighty... (sees Fitzgerald doesn't ARGUE) ...five. Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket. FITZGERALD You boys are leavin' me with nothin'. Better be a helluva horse. RUNTY MAN Pick of the litter. The Runty Man snatches the cash. RUNTY MAN (cont'd) And when you see that scarred-up nigger, you tell him he'd best not show up here again. Fitzgerald freezes... not sure he heard correctly. FITZGERALD When I see who? 92. RUNTY MAN The black son of a bitch that robbed me. You tell him that. A long beat, then... FITZGERALD Scarred up, you say... and headed up to Union? RUNTY MAN That's what he told us. Seemed real anxious to get there too. FITZGERALD (NODS) I'll make sure to give him the message when I find him. EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY Fitzgerald sits on the horse, staring back over the ground... his LINE OF TRACKS LEADING THROUGH THE SNOW. He turns... looks south, then back to the tracks. Finally, Fitzgerald digs his heels into the horse. The animal takes off, right along Fitzgerald's tracks in the snow... right back toward Glass. EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - DAY Thick ice along the edges, tapering to a narrow stream of flowing water at the very center. Glass and Henry ride along the snow-covered bank. HENRY Hugh. Henry points. Glass follows his finger along the river... to a CANOE resting on the bank ahead. They dismount... examine the canoe... the letters "RMFC" painted on the side. HENRY (CONT'D) That's it. Glass runs his mittened hand along the gashes in the wood. GLASS Ice tore it up. 93. Glass looks to the FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, leading deep into the trees. He glances up to the sky... clear and blue. GLASS (CONT'D) If the snow holds off, we'll have a good trail to track. HENRY What's out that direction? Talbot? GLASS And the Missouri. Doubt he'd risk the river with the `Ree. Likely grab a horse, and cross over high... take his chances goin' east against the weather. When'd you say he skipped out? HENRY Three days ago now. GLASS We best pick up our pace. They climb back onto their horses... trot into the trees. EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY Glass and Henry gallop across, their path dead on Fitzgerald's tracks. EXT. FOREST - DAY The snow is shallow here, the ground protected by the trees. There's a black spot where a fire once burned, and footprints all over the place. Glass is off his horse, crouched, studying the site... lifting the charred chunks of wood. HENRY This was Fitzgerald camped here? GLASS Couple nights back. But these tracks aren't all his. HENRY He's travelin' with somebody? 94. GLASS (shakes his head) Came in after. Prints are smooth. Mocassins. Henry throws Glass a look... he knows what that means. GLASS (CONT'D) Could be Sioux... Blackfoot even. HENRY But you figure they're `Ree. GLASS I don't figure nothin', Captain. But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald. Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away from camp. Henry rides after him. GLASS (CONT'D) And they're on his trail too, so we should keep it quiet... don't announce we're back here. HENRY You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree. GLASS I do. HENRY You figure this is smart then? Glass swings up onto his horse. GLASS You're welcome to head back, Captain. Glass trots off. Henry watches him a beat, then throws a glance into the trees... follows after Glass. EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Glass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging the dirt over the fire and rocks. Henry's under a blanket, watching him. 95. HENRY What if we find Fitzgerald... and I ask you not to do this? Glass spreads a blanket over the ground. GLASS Don't ask me. Glass settles in on the warm earth. Henry just keeps watching him. EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER ANGLE ON HENRY... ...asleep under the blanket. O.S. RUSTLING sends his eyes flashing open. He raises up... rifle ready. He glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips. HENRY (WHISPERS) `Ree? Glass doesn't answer... just keeps searching the brush. Henry's groggy eyes dart around the night... spots MOVEMENT IN THE BRUSH. HENRY (CONT'D) There! GLASS Wait! But it's too late... Henry fires... BOOM... the shot explodes through the night... ...and the DEER leaps away. Henry looks to Glass... shakes his head... sorry. HENRY So much for stayin' quiet. CUT TO: 96. FITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE... ...staring out into the darkness, as the GUNSHOT ECHOES OVER HIM. Fitzgerald immediately throws dirt over the flames. EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Glass and Henry are loaded up, back on their horses. HENRY Guess you would've been better off on your own. GLASS We needed to pick up some time anyways. The two riders disappear into the dark trees. EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT Glass and Henry riding across a meadow. Glass stops... tilts his head back to sniff the air. HENRY Whatta ya got? GLASS Smoke. Glass pulls some snow from his horse's mane... tosses it in the air, and watches it blow to the side. Glass turns his horse toward the breeze... squints out into the night. GLASS (CONT'D) No more than mile out that way. (pulls his rifle) I'll head in from the west... you take the east. HENRY What if it's `Ree? GLASS Then we leave `em be... meet back up here. 97. Henry nods... Glass takes off at a trot. Henry veers the other direction... splitting up across the snow. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines. Glass on horseback, walking through the trees... appearing and disappearing. He spots something in the distance... the slightest of glows. Glass eases off his horse... wraps the reins around a branch. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry's already off his horse... leading it through the trees... searching as he walks. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass moves silently through the darkness... rifle poised to aim and fire... just like the first time we saw him, perfectly comfortable in this world. His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth... picking up everything. He reaches the glow... the remains of a campfire. The slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air. Glass crouches down, studying the surround ground... HOOF-PRINTS blended in with the other tracks. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry's horse is making too much noise with each step. He stops walking... wraps the reins around a tree... walks back around the horse... ...AND THERE'S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM... ...Glass' Anstadt aimed and ready to fire. FITZGERALD Didn't figure an important man like you to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain. You lost? Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle. His eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle. 98. HENRY I'm here to save your life. FITZGERALD I done told you boys... I don't need savin' by you or nobody else. Henry knows he's only got one chance... he makes a grab for the rifle. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass running his fingers across the tracks. Suddenly an O.S. GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE. Glass spins to it... races back through the trees toward his horse. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass at full gallop through the woods... veering between trees... ducking branches. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Glass charges from the forest... spots Henry's horse standing in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground with his rifle ready... ...and sees HENRY'S BODY face-up in the snow. Glass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides over to Henry... ...and we see he's a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest leaking out onto the snow... HIS HEAD SCALPED... LEFT EAR SLICED OFF. Glass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into the distance around him. But there's nothing out there. Glass SCREAMS in rage. He turns back to Henry... crouches down over him. GLASS You shouldn't a come. As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head. And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL. 99. Glass stares at Henry a beat, then squints out into the forest. GLASS (CONT'D) (repeating Spotted Horse's words under his breath) Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you. EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT Glass on horseback, leading Henry's horse behind him across the snow-covered meadow. Henry's fur-covered body is draped over the saddle. EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a bit at the center. Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at the thick ice to get to the water beneath. He makes a hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into the darkness. Then Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest beyond... like he knows what's waiting for him there. He walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the slope... Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in his bloody furs. Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that slope. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST... ...watching from the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry draped over the horse behind. The forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and branches under the horses' hooves. Then BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN'T SEEN BESIDE US FLASHES IN THE NIGHT... ...and Glass tumbles off his horse. 100. The horses prance around with a start, then settle... and then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves. He reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering him. And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to suddenly roll over firing... ...but Glass doesn't move. Fitzgerald nudges him with his boot, then crouches down... grabs Glass by the shoulder, and pulls him over... ...and there's HENRY'S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back. ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY'S HORSE... ...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS' SADDLE to hold Henry upright... ...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second horse... MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a rifle... the head raising up... it's GLASS... taking aim... ...as Fitzgerald realizes what's happened... spins with the Anstadt... ...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on Fitzgerald... BOOM... BOOM... both rifles explode... ...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush. Fitzgerald's wild shot hits Henry's horse, sending it rearing up, tossing Glass to the ground. But Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he charges into the brush... ...but FITZGERALD IS GONE. Until the flash of movement behind Glass... he turns... as the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air... WHACK... clubs him across the head, sending him tumbling down the slope to the frozen river. Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER, snatches up his knife, and charges down the slope to finish Glass off. 101. EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT Glass lies on the ice, barely conscious. Blood oozes down his head... over his eyes. He wipes it away to see Fitzgerald barreling down toward him. Fitzgerald dives in attack, but Glass kicks up his leg, sending Fitzgerald flying over... SLAMMING into the frozen river, his head CRACKING THE ICE. Glass rips the knife from his belt... moves after Fitzgerald, his feet slipping and sliding under him. Fitzgerald rises to his feet... the men charge like two wild animals... crash into each other... knives flailing. They roll along the ice, blades glistening... slicing through furs... across flesh. Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down... plants it through the back of Glass' hand, pinning it to the ice. Glass CRIES OUT... drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald's out. As he does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing back... sliding to the center of the river. The thin ice around him splinters... cracks. Glass looks up... sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him, HOLDING BOTH KNIVES now. Glass is trapped... ...until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice... it begins to give... he pounds it again and again... Fitzgerald speeds up to get to Glass in time... raises one of the knives, as Glass shatters the ice... drops beneath the surface. Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his feet, forcing him back. CUT TO: UNDERWATER... ...and Glass just under the ice, floating with the current. His fingers search for a hole, but there's nothing. CUT TO: 102. FITZGERALD... ...making his way down the river, peering through the ice, searching for Glass. He spots something... stops... leans close to make out the shape... it's GLASS' FEET. Then suddenly, GLASS' FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT FITZGERALD'S FEET... grab Fitzgerald's leg, pulling him down. Fitzgerald crashes to the ice... it splinters around him... gives away, and he sinks into the icy water... but the ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE... holds him against the current. Glass drags himself from the water... stands... stares down at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole... his face looking up at Glass through the ice. Glass lifts one of the fallen knives... stands over Fitzgerald. FITZGERALD (through the water and ICE) Help me! (off Glass' stare) Glass... please! Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with Bridger that night in the bunkhouse. And then Glass leans down... grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up. Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE ANSTADT, sending Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as Glass holds on to the Anstadt. CUT TO: FITZGERALD... ...floating under the surface... pounding at the ice as he drifts, until his swinging slows... stops... his body drifts away. EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT Glass stands on the ice, blood dripping down his face, holding his Anstadt. He begins to tremble... not from the cold, but from finally reaching the end of this journey. His eyes begin to fill with tears... 103. ...and then he sees ELK'S TONGUE, and SEVERAL OTHER ARIKARA WARRIORS watching him from the other side of the river. Glass and Elk's Tongue exchange a long stare, until finally Glass SCREAMS OUT. GLASS I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed whites and I have killed Arikara and I have killed grizzly! AND I WILL KILL YOU! Elk's Tongue doesn't move... just stares back at Glass... soaked in blood and water. Then Glass CRIES OUT at the warriors again. GLASS (CONT'D) COME ON! But the Arikara don't attack... don't move at all... until Elk's Tongue gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns... they disappear back into the trees. Glass watches them fade away, then collapses to his knees on the icy river... exhausted in every possible way. He begins to cry. FADE OUT. THE ENDDeadpool Script at IMSDb.

DEADPOOL Written by Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick Final Shooting Script - November 16, 2015 OVER BLACK. Low volume, through a tinny speaker, JUICE NEWTON'S `ANGEL OF THE MORNING.' FADE UP ON: 1 EXT./INT. TAXI CAB - MORNING 1 DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the BACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY. Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon. The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from the rear view to the road to the rear view. DEADPOOL Kinda lonesome back here. CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening between the back seat and front. His two katanas don't cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Little help? The cabbie grabs Deadpool's hand and pulls him through to the front. Deadpool's head rests upside down on the bench seat as he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice. CABBIE Dopinder. DEADPOOL (still upside-down) Pool. Deadpool. Dopinder is remarkably UNAFFECTED by the lunatic in his cab. DOPINDER Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool? DEADPOOL It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty- two days, three hours... (checks `Adventure Time' watch) ...and thirty-six minutes for this shit. (CONTINUED) 2. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 1 CONTINUED: 1 DEADPOOL turns himself RIGHT-SIDE-UP in the front seat. He is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS. TWIN DESERT EAGLE .50 CALIBER PISTOLS. Deadpool grabs Dopinder's OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinder isn't quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out the window onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl that looks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic. Deadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE of the bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY. Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Points. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Nice. Dopinder eyes his DAFFODIL DAYDREAM AIR FRESHENER and takes a deep breath through his nose. DOPINDER Smells good, no? DEADPOOL Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl. A PICTURE of a young INDIAN WOMAN is taped to the dash. DOPINDER Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She was supposed to make me a very agreeable wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather excellently. But Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive. DEADPOOL Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in this cab for a reason. DOPINDER Because you hailed it? DEADPOOL No, my slender brown friend... to give you one crucial piece of advice: Love... is a beautiful thing. When it finds you, the whole world smells like Daffodil Daydream. Deadpool's own heartbreak is palpable. He takes another deep, cleansing BREATH. (CONTINUED) 3. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 1 CONTINUED: (2) 1 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the whole world will taste like Mama June after hot yoga. DOPINDER And how does Ms. Mama June taste? DEADPOOL Like two hobos making love under a drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day like this. Point is, bad. Deadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two magazines. Suddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywood agent who can't find his phone. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave them right by the door so I'll trip over them! Someone must've moved them... 2 INT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY 2 A blind late-70's AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in a purple floral dress enters the front door, falls as she trips over an `I *HEART* HELLO KITTY' DUFFEL BAG of AMMUNITION, PICKS it UP, and CARRIES it OFF. 3 INT./EXT. TAXI CAB - MORNING 3 DOPINDER Shall we turn back? DEADPOOL No time. Not today. (slides in last bullets) Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust. (chambers a shell into each gun, looks up) Right here! The cab SCREECHES to a stop on the shoulder of the highest FREEWAY in a massive INTERCHANGE of freeways. Dopinder halts the meter and hands Deadpool his CARD. DOPINDER My card. That's $27.50. (CONTINUED) 4. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 3 CONTINUED: 3 DEADPOOL Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm working. Ruins the lines of my suit. How 'bout a crisp high five? Dopinder stares as he and Deadpool slap skin. Deadpool GETS OUT of the cab. DOPINDER Be sure to... ask for me again? DEADPOOL I owe you one. Merry Christmas, Dopinder. DOPINDER And a convivial... Tuesday in April to you, Pool... Guy. Deadpool closes the door with a flourish. Boom. 4 EXT./INT. `THE RAFT' PRISON - MORNING 4 A bone-white ISLAND PRISON, affectionately nicknamed `The Raft,' looms ominously in a CITY HARBOR. Etched in helvetica into the prison wall: `No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes.' - Hannah Arendt. Below it, GRAFFITIED in RED SPRAY PAINT: `Until NOW' The prison's FRONT DOORS OPEN, and out steps a handcuffed PRISONER, 30's, ORANGE JUMPSUIT, broad shoulders, whip-smart, tightly coiled, with cool, dead-blue eyes. BURLY GUARDS guide him across a CAUSEWAY toward a CONVOY of Escalades and Ducatis on shore. The middle Escalade's door opens. The prisoner stops. The guards unlock his CUFFS. GUARD You're someone else's problem now. The ex-prisoner STRETCHES his arms and strides TOWARD the convoy. PRISONER Yes. I. Am. CUE SALT & PEPA'S `SHOOP:' 5. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 5 EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY 5 DEADPOOL sits on the edge of the highest freeway on the overpass, legs dangling over the side like Huck Finn. DEADPOOL Can I get some fries with that shake- shake boobie? If looks could kill you would be an uzi. Deadpool is using some broken CRAYONS to draw something on a scrap of paper. REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL a childish drawing of Deadpool SHOOTING another man in the head, brains blowing out. The victim's thought bubble reads: `OUCHIE!!!' Even through the mask, Deadpool looks pleased by this. He turns to CAMERA: DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Oh, hello, Deadpool here. You may be wondering whose balls I had to fondle to get my own movie. Rhymes with `Polverine.' Couple'a smooth criminals. (ALT:) In a word, gorgeous. (ALT:) Surprisingly little hair down there. (ALT:) It's a jungle down there. (ALT:) Thick underbrush. (beat) Anyway, I smell Oscar. The suit's gonna match the carpet. Now... places to be... faces to fix... bad guys to kill... ANGLE ON a distant BIRD'S EYE VIEW of the freeway interchange: an interwoven tangle of ramps. 6 EXT. REMOTE AIRFIELD - MORNING 6 AJAX, 30's, dead-blue eyes, broad shoulders, whip-smart, tightly coiled stands at ease on a cracked and blistered tarmac. Behind him, a HEAVILY ARMED CONVOY OF DUCATIS and ESCALADES. FOUR LARGE ALUMINUM CARGO CRATES sit beside him. Ajax squints into the sun as A BELL HELICOPTER thrashes the air above him, kicking up dust as it lands. (CONTINUED) 6. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 6 CONTINUED: 6 A SERBIAN WARLORD, mid-50's, sharply dressed, armored BRIEFCASE in hand, climbs out. He is surrounded by ARMED GUARDS. The Warlord places the BRIEFCASE on the FOREMOST CRATE. Ajax pops the case... to find STACKS upon STACKS of THOUSAND DOLLAR BILLS. Satisfied, he closes the briefcase and hands it to one of his men. AJAX (bangs crate) They won't disappoint. WARLORD They'd better not. And next month's shipment? AJAX There won't be one. Demand is high. You aren't the only one with a war to win. WARLORD (steps forward) That won't do. Both sets of armed thugs shift to ready positions. Ajax smiles calmly, but his free hand DARTS OUT and CASUALLY LIFTS the warlord into the air by the THROAT. Fingers find triggers on both sides. AJAX There's been a small... disruption in our supply chain. We'll deliver in full the following month. Say, ten percent off for the inconvenience? The Warlord manages to nod in acquiescence. Ajax smiles again, lowers him gasping to the ground. AJAX (CONT'D) We appreciate your business. Ajax spins and walks purposefully toward the line of waiting SUV's. The warlord angrily motions for his men to begin loading the crates into the helicopter, which they do. WARLORD (sotto voce) Fucking mutant. (CONTINUED) 7. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 6 CONTINUED: (2) 6 Behind him the convoy of SUV's and motorcycles pull out, falling into line as they accelerate past the rows of derelict aircraft. 7 EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY 7 DEADPOOL watches as the convoy approaches. He CASUALLY gets up as if standing up out of an easy chair... DEADPOOL On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop... He PIROUETTES, and DROPS an entire level DOWN... 8 INT. ESCALADE - MORNING 8 THROUGH the SUNROOF of an ESCALADE. SMASH! There are FOUR HUGE BAD-ASSES inside the S.U.V., two in front, two behind. Deadpool lands back-middle in a HAILSTORM of GLASS. He stuns the men to both sides with elbows to the face as he raises his arms in greeting. DEADPOOL ¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte! (subtitled, in YELLOW:) Hello! My name is the Pool of Death. There's no easy way to say this. I'm pregnant, Trevor. (ALT:) Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me neither. BOOM! MAYHEM ERUPTS as the two men in back find themselves sharing a phone booth with the TASMANIAN DEVIL: ELBOWS. FOREARMS. KNEES. CRACKING. CRUNCHING. SCREAMING. From BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE. A brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls with it, uses his FEET to BREAK the man's NECK. The other man stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool's face into the seat's premium trim. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Rich... Corinthian... Leather. Deadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW. The man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V. Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT. (CONTINUED) 8. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 8 CONTINUED: 8 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Scuse, por favor! The DRIVER SLAMS Deadpool's head into the console repeatedly. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Deadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy in the PASSENGER SEAT. He GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy's ANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy's HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he's DRAGGED mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just got stuck in his horse's STIRRUP. Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD and BANGS his FOREHEAD into: The horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver's forehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION CHANGES: MARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL ('SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!'). One more SMACK to get us back to MARIACHI. Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back CRAWL up the tailgate. Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac's CIGARETTE LIGHTER. Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the DRIVER's SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. We're now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver's expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of pain every time it's MUSHED into the glass. The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD. Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man's forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man SCREAMS. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Loved your work in Daredevil. Deadpool stuffs the lighter INTO the man's mouth and CLAMPS his hand over it. (CONTINUED) 9. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 8 CONTINUED: (2) 8 The man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulled AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path. The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN. Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver's neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the OTHER hand still clamped over the second man's mouth. He plants both FEET on the steering wheel and `drives,' spinning the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into... ...a ROLL. The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY. Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW... The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike. Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING. Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass. BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB tied to MOBY DICK. The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES. The camera swoops in to Deadpool's face, upside down. HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT'S MOVING: DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shit. Did I leave the stove on? We RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The guy's ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES high toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame. The RIDER's NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN. The DRIVER is half-way out the SUNROOF when the S.U.V. rolls over him. SQUISH. The man who ate the CIGARETTE LIGHTER now eats pavement. VX8 EXT. X-MANSION - DAY VX8 A sign reads `PROFESSOR XAVIER'S SCHOOL FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS. (CONTINUED) 10. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 VX8 CONTINUED: VX8 REPORTER (O.S.) Breaking news. A multicar collision turns shots fired on the crosstown expressway... The sign sits on the perfectly manicured front lawn of the gorgeous Gothic X-MANSION. VX8 INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS VX8 The X-Men's COLOSSUS. A GOOD-NATURED GIANT with CHROME METAL FOR SKIN. BIG AS A BARN. OTHER-WORLDLY STRONG. He is sitting in the kitchen, eating a bowl of GRAPE NUTS and finishing a SUDOKU, his attention suddenly drawn to a TELEVISION SCREEN: REPORTER The assailant appears to be wearing a... COLOSSUS REPORTER (CONT'D) Red suit? Red suit. With an audible CRACK, the pencil in Colossus' thick fingers snaps. He rises, muttering Russian curses and stalks from the kitchen. VC8 INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER VC8 Massive STEEL BLAST DOORS emblazoned with a huge "X" slide open to reveal COLOSSUS. He walks quickly and purposefully towards a big plane in the center of the huge space: the BLACKBIRD, the X-Men's modified XR-71 jet transport. Struggling to keep up with the giant's long strides is a supernaturally CUTE, supernaturally DEADPAN 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL, in an X-MEN outfit. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD. COLOSSUS I've given Deadpool every chance to join us. And what is my reward? More immaturity and criminality! When will he finally grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man? NTW Like... The house that blows up every few years? The fashion-forward jump-suits? I need to get myself kicked out of X- School. COLOSSUS But I thought you were at top of class. (CONTINUED) 11. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 VC8 CONTINUED: VC8 NTW Was that sarcasm? Awesome. COLOSSUS You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day. (hands NTW a protein bar) Here. Protein bar, good for bones. Deadpool may try to break yours. NTW shoves the bar in a pocket of her coat without breaking stride. 9 EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - MORNING 9 The S.U.V. slides to a halt ON ITS SIDE, PASSENGER WINDOWS UP. The rest of the CONVOY is forced to stop BEHIND. A BUNCH of MEN PILE OUT, each one carrying a BEASTLY GUN and POINTING it STRAIGHT at the disabled S.U.V. The last noise is made by one final dislodged HUBCAP, which rattles in little circles until it lies FLAT on the freeway. TWO SILENT BEATS. Then we hear the soft, ELECTRIC BUZZ of the Escalade's middle passenger window ROLLING DOWN. Up pops the HEAD of DEADPOOL, like the GOPHER in Caddyshack. BANG BANG BANG BANG. DEADPOOL Wait, wait... The head drops, the hands come up. BANG. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Wait! You're probably wondering. Why the red suit? It's so bad guys can't see me bleed. This guy has the idea. He wore the brown pants. (to camera) All together now... The THUGS immediately OPEN FIRE. Deadpool is already leaping upward, flipping backwards, bullets tearing the air beneath him as he pulls out those TWO MASSIVE .50 CAL PISTOLS... and in slo-mo, RETURNS FIRE. Deadpool keeps count of every bullet he fires: DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Twelve..! (CONTINUED) 12. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 9 CONTINUED: 9 A SHELL-CASING is EJECTED. We enter EXTREME SLO-MO and SWOOP IN on the shell as it TUMBLES through the air... ...revealing the number `00012' ETCHED in a semi-circle on its butt end. Deadpool FIRES the second pistol. We move instantly to the second shell: `00011' DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Eleven... FULL SPEED. The first TWO THUGS get a MOUTHFUL of BULLET. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ten... ANOTHER SHOT. A THUG takes one in the HEART. The other thugs POUR LEAD into the disabled S.U.V. Deadpool LEAPS UP and OUT of the window, rising ABOVE the incoming shots, then LANDING SAFELY BEHIND the Escalade. Deadpool TURNS to SPY a MOTORCYCLE RIDER BEARING DOWN ON HIM. This rider wears a distinctive SILVER HELMET. Deadpool raises BOTH pistols. This RIDER LEANS away, dodging each slug. First left, then right, then left. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Nine. Shit! Eight. Fuck! Seven. Shit- fuck! The bike WHIZZES PAST safely, firing bullets, DEADPOOL follows, leaping high, flipping over the S.U.V. He lands smoothly the other side, right BEHIND a thug who's looking in the other direction as he sneaks around the car. Deadpool SHRUGS and SHOOTS him in the BACK of the HEAD at POINT BLANK RANGE. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Six. The shell tumbles to the ground, falls still. `00006' Deadpool opens the Escalade. His target is NOT THERE. BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Deadpool is nearly BROUGHT DOWN by a particularly big thug with a particularly big AK-47. He dives behind another Escalade, takes a moment to search the interior through the windows... and then flinches as AK- 47 bullets pass THROUGH the skin of the S.U.V. around him. (CONTINUED) 13. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 9 CONTINUED: (2) 9 One of the bullets lands in DEADPOOL'S BICEP. Deadpool yelps, in pain... then stuffs some of his torn red suit fabric into the hole to staunch the bleeding. Then he scrambles AROUND the S.U.V., trying to close the distance to this guy through a WITHERING BARRAGE of fire. Another of the AK's slugs SLICES a swath out of the mask on Deadpool's head, SINGING his hair. DEADPOOL. Fuck. You. Deadpool lands in FRONT of the thug. The thug pulls his trigger again, only to - CLICK - realize he's OUT of BULLETS. DEADPOOL Someone's not counting. Cinco. The bullet HITS the thug in the throat. `00005' DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Me gusta cinco. Deadpool STRIDES past the fallen thug, pawing at his singed hair - ow - and then out of sheer, pumped-up ANGER... ...turns and PUMPS TWO MORE SUPERFLUOUS BULLETS into him. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Four. Three. Stupid. Worth it. The SILVER-HELMETED MOTORCYCLE RIDER makes another pass, FIRING. Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. again. 20 yards away, a GROUP of thugs TAKE COVER behind the final S.U.V. One pulls out a HAND-GRENADE, RAISES HIS ARM to throw. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (chuckles) Number two... Deadpool FIRES, SHOOTING the GRENADE in the thug's FIST. BOOM! The whole CLUSTER of THUGS drops. Deadpool emerges from behind the S.U.V., feeling victorious. He approaches the final S.U.V. and throws open the doors to search, expecting to find his target at last. Inside is a rumpled orange prison coverall, but NOT the PRISONER. Deadpool gets childishly angry. (CONTINUED) 14. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 9 CONTINUED: (3) 9 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) What the shit-biscuit! Where you at, Francis? Worse, CLICK-CLACK. The distinctive COCKING of SHOTGUNS. 3 final THUGS stand on the freeway, lined up perpendicular to Deadpool, SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER, FIRING BENELLI COMBAT SHOTGUNS. BAM! BAM! BAM! Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. and raises a PISTOL. We ZOOM IN through the CHAMBER to spy the last BULLET, POISED in front of the FIRING PIN: `00001' Deadpool thinks, then LEAPS from behind the `SCLADE, TWISTS forward and right. All 3 THUGS FIRE again. BUCKSHOT rips into DEADPOOL's BACK. But he LANDS so that all 3 men are now parallel to him... ...in A SINGLE-FILE LINE. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) One. BOOM! We're with the FINAL BULLET as it HURTLES from the gun and passes THROUGH the first man's head... then the SECOND man's head... and SMACKS the third man in the forehead. This third man, the BIGGEST THUG YET, HITS the DECK. Deadpool puts his mouth to his pistol barrel, INHALES... and then EXHALES smoke through the pores of his mask. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I'm touching myself tonight. But then, as if by magic, the third thug STIRS... and STANDS. The SLUG has LODGED partway in his FOREHEAD, having lost just enough momentum that it didn't make it all the way through. The thug sneers, plucks out the slug, wipes away some blood, and rolls up his SLEEVES. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Really? Rolling up the sleeves? Deadpool reaches back. We hear the THRILLING SOUND... (CONTINUED) 15. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 9 CONTINUED: (4) 9 ...of STEEL BLADES being DRAWN. Out come Deadpool's TRADEMARK KATANAS. The thug's eyes widen as... ...SWOOSH... the blades swing through the air and SKEWER him, between two different ribs and out the BACK. DEADPOOL (V.O.) I know what you're thinking... The action SLOWS again to a FREEZE. Deadpool is in mid- slice, muscles bulging. DEADPOOL (V.O.) I'll bet he works out. So what if I am pulling the double shift at the ab- factory? What if I do want my man menu to feature the shredded beef? Call it insecurity. But I haven't touched a carb since... 10 INT. FOYER, TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT - PAST 10 Title: 6 Years Ago A sleazy, mid-thirties MAN, GAVIN MERCHANT, decked out in DRAGON PRINT V-NECK and STUDDED JEANS, is MID-ARGUMENT with a late teen, pimply-faced PIZZA DELIVERY GUY, whose name-tag reads: JEREMY. MERCHANT Will it help if I slow down? I didn't. Order. The pizza. JEREMY This 7348 Red Ledge Drive? (off nod) And you're... Mr. Merchant? MERCHANT The Mr. Merchant who didn't. Order. The. Fucking. Pie. JEREMY Then who placed the call? A TOILET flushes in another room, and both men turn. WADE (O.S.) I did. (CONTINUED) 16. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 10 CONTINUED: 10 The VOICE comes from over Merchant's shoulder. WADE WILSON (the future DEADPOOL, MINUS the SCARS and SUIT), handsome, boyish, cheerily steps from through a doorway and into the living room wiping his hands on a towel. Merchant STARES, incredulous. WADE (CONT'D) Pineapple and olive? Jeremy NODS. WADE (CONT'D) Sweet and salty. MERCHANT The fuck are you? And what are you doing in my crib?! Without even turning toward Merchant, Wade PULLS OUT A .50 CALIBER DESERT EAGLE PISTOL and nonchalantly AIMS it at him. Merchant and Jeremy both go pale. WADE (to Jeremy) Burnt crust? JEREMY God I hope not. (opens the box, winces) Words cannot express- WADE Relax, son, that's hows I likes it! Once you go black, you never go back! (takes pizza) MERCHANT (stammering) This is about the poker game, right? I told Howie... Listen, take whatever you want! Merchant fumbles with his wallet and starts to hand Wade the bills inside. Wade takes the ENTIRE WALLET instead. WADE Thanks! JEREMY (to Wade) Uh. Sir? Before you do anything to him. Could I have a big tip? (CONTINUED) 17. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 10 CONTINUED: (2) 10 WADE (already munching) Jeremy, is it? JEREMY Yeah. WADE Wade Wilson. (quick fist bump) Jeremy, that's a no go on the tiperoo. I'm not here for him. (levels gun at Jeremy) I'm here for you. Jeremy's eyes widen. Wade holds up a YELLOW CARD, featuring an embedded SIM. Below the logo of a CYPRESS TREE is the name of Wade's intended target: `GARRETT, JEREMY.' Merchant breathes a sigh of relief. MERCHANT Dodged a big time bullet on that o- Wade PISTOL-PUNCHES/POKES Merchant in the forehead. Merchant howls. WADE (re: studded jeans) Not out of the woods yet. You need to seriously ease up on the bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier. (sniffs) And the Axe body spray. JEREMY (sheepish) That's unfortunately me. WADE PS, I'm keeping your wallet. Ya did kinda give it to me... MERCHANT Can I at least have my Sam's Club card baaa- Wade points the pistol at Merchant again, sending him backpedaling into a chair. WADE I will shoot your fucking cat. (CONTINUED) 18. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 10 CONTINUED: (3) 10 MERCHANT I don't have a cat! WADE Then whose kitty-litter did I just shit in? (turns to Jeremy) Anyhoo, you by chance know a Meghan Orlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky? Orloskvy? Do you? Jeremy manages a timid little NOD. WADE (CONT'D) Good. `Cause she knows you. Wade holsters the pistol and WHIPS out a HUNTING KNIFE. He twirls it adeptly... but instead of holding it to Jeremy's neck... CUTS himself a SLICE of PIZZA. WADE (CONT'D) What situation isn't improved by pizza? Wade shovels half the slice into his mouth, revealing an Army SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO on his forearm: A SKULL WEARING A GREEN BERET, BACKED BY A BLADE, AND THE WORDS `DE OPPRESSO LIBER' (official motto of the U.S. Army Special Forces). WADE (CONT'D) (through chews) Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down. (cuts another pizza slice) Little Meghan's not made of money, but lucky her, I've got a soft spot. Wade brings the next pizza slice over to Merchant. Wade nearly hands it to him but lets go too soon. The slice falls flat - pineapple down - onto the floor at Merchant's feet. JEREMY B-but I'm- WADE (returns to Jeremy) A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. Though not nearly as bad as serrated steel. Wade pokes the end of his knife into Jeremy's chest, pinning him against the wall. WADE (CONT'D) So keep away from Meghan. We cool? (CONTINUED) 19. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 10 CONTINUED: (4) 10 JEREMY Y-yeah. A beat. In a huge ANTI-CLIMAX, Wade deftly twirls his knife AWAY from Jeremy's chest, SPINS it on his finger, and JAMS it back into its SLEEVE. WADE Then we're done. JEREMY W-we are? WADE Soft spot, remember? But even look in her general direction again? You'll learn in the worst of ways. (pats Jeremy's cheek) I've got some hard spots too. (pauses) That came out wrong. Or did it? 11 EXT. SKATE PARK - NIGHT - PAST 11 SKATE PUNKS carve on ramps built into the sides of a highway underpass. A group of TEEN GIRLS are perched at the bottom of the nearby stairs, texting each other from inches away. An old-fashioned GHETTO BLASTER bangs `SHOOP.' SALT & PEPA I love you in your big jeans. GIRLS (join chorus) You give me nice dreams. You make me wanna scream... Boom. A PIZZA BOX lands at their feet. On top of it lands a POLAROID PICTURE. WADE (O.S.) "Oooo, oooo, oooo!" A FRIZZY-HAIRED EMO GIRL picks up the Polaroid... of a terrified JEREMY holding another pizza box that has been cut into a heart, the words `I'm Sorry' scrawled onto it, a PEE- STAIN on his JEANS, and a laughing WADE photo-bombing with the knife to his neck. She looks UP to see: Wade bobbing to the music. WADE (CONT'D) You've seen the last of Jeremy. (CONTINUED) 20. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 11 CONTINUED: 11 The girl - MEGHAN ORLOVSKY - leaps up and HUGS Wade tight. WADE (CONT'D) That's why we do it. GIRL #2 Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad? GIRL #3 How `bout Vice Principal Renwiki? WADE (suddenly serious) What'd he do to you? GIRL #3 Suspended me for smoking. WADE (turns to go) Good for him! Sorry, ladies. Me no dig cigs. And I may look mean. But if I give a guy a pavement facial? He earned it. Wade gives Meghan a smile, turns to leave. MEGHAN Hey. Thanks. You're my hero. The word catches Wade like a punch to the gut. Hero? WADE That I ain't. Wade doesn't turn back, walking through the swooping skaters. A12 EXT. SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST A12 A grimy SIGN on a grimier brick building reads: `SISTER MARGARET'S SCHOOL FOR WAYWARD GIRLS.' 12 INT. SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST 12 Inside, society's DREGS. Chief among them, BOOTHE: a HUGE, menacing hipster with a BOY SCOUT CAP and MASSIVE HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE. He's got some DUDE's fingers splayed out on the bar, jabbing a KNIFE POINT between them as fast as he can. WADE shimmies past, backslaps BOOTHE: WADE Boothe! (CONTINUED) 21. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 12 CONTINUED: 12 BOOTHE (turns, smiles) Heya, Wade! We hear a STAB and a SCREAM. Wade winces as he continues on to the BAR, claims a STOOL and waves over the lone bartender - WEASEL, early 20's, geeky, glasses. Think Tom Cruise in `Cocktail.' Then think the opposite. WEASEL Wade Wilson, Patron Saint of the Pitiful. What can I get you? WADE I'd love a blow-job. WEASEL We got that in common. WADE The drink, moose-knuckle. But first... Wade digs in a pocket, slaps the YELLOW `HIT' CARD, the one with the CYPRESS TREE, on the bar. Weasel goes to the register. Scans the card. Peels off three ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. Lays them out like a bank teller. Wade PUSHES the MONEY AWAY... WADE (CONT'D) I ain't taking allowance money. Make sure it gets back to Ms. Osflorsky? Onroflensky? Olly-Olly-Oxen-Free? WEASEL Orlofsky. For a merc, you sure are warm- blooded. Bet you let the boy off easy- peasy, too. WADE (embarrassed) He's not a bad kid, Weas. Just a little light stalking. I was way worse at his age- traveling to far-off places - Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville - (shudders) - meeting new and exciting people - (CONTINUED) 22. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 12 CONTINUED: (2) 12 WEASEL And killing them. I've seen your Instagram. What was Special Forces doing in Jacksonville, anyway? WADE Classified. (whispers) They have a wonderful TGIFridays. Those guys know their way around a Loaded Potato Skin. The point is, I'm trying to put those days in my rear-view. Weasel puts the finishing touches on the drink, pushes it across the bar to Wade. WEASEL Kahlua, Bailey's, whip cream. Fellatio in a glass. A burst of laughter turns Wade's attention to BUCK, a BAD-ASS in a snakeskin jacket, has a crowd gathered round him, mid- story. He too is holding a YELLOW CARD with SIM and CYPRESS TREE. BUCK So he's staring at my Glock in his mouth, like... (mouth full) `I thought you guys had a code!' And I'm like, `Yeah, no kids. No women. Almost fooled by your tits. But the moustache?! The crowd CRACKS UP. Wade pulls out Gavin Merchant's wallet and teases out a TWENTY. He grabs a passing waitress, tucks the bill in her shirt pocket and sets the blowjob on her tray. WADE Kelly, you mind taking this over to Buck? Tell him it's from Boothe. (whispers, to Weasel) Little foreplay. Weasel follows Wade's gaze to the end of the bar, where a chuckling BOOTHE wraps a bandage around the guy's bloody hand. WEASEL Remind me what good comes of this? (CONTINUED) 23. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 12 CONTINUED: (3) 12 WADE I don't take the shits. I just disturb them. Weasel allows himself a tiny conspiratorial SMILE. SMASH CUT TO: 13 INT. SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT 13 WADE, in medium shot, TEARING UP at the famous Steven Seagal bar fight from `OUT FOR JUSTICE' on T.V. as... SMACK... BAM... a REAL bar fight goes on - OUT OF FOCUS - behind him. WADE (trailer voice) It's a dirty job... but someone's gotta take out the garbage. Wade finally turns around to watch. BUCK finishes off Boothe... then pours the BLOW-JOB on top of him. WEASEL grabs a hand mirror, hops over the bar, and crosses to Boothe. All the PATRONS fall HUSH as WEASEL holds the mirror to Boothe's mouth. Boothe's BREATH FOGS it up. WEASEL Still kicking. The place `oooooohs.' Near miss. Weasel returns to his place behind the bar, looking disappointed. WADE Lemme guess. Ya got Boothe in Sister Margaret's dead pool. WEASEL Um. See. About that- WADE You did not bet on me to die. (looks up at board, incredulous) You bet on me to die. Wade leans back and looks up at an ENORMOUS CHALKBOARD hanging above the bar: `Sister Margaret's DEAD POOL.' Below, a long LIST of NAMES. DOLLAR AMOUNTS to the right of the names. More NAMES to the right of the dollars. Indeed, `WEASEL' has chosen `WADE.' Wade looks betrayed. (CONTINUED) 24. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 13 CONTINUED: 13 WADE (CONT'D) Weasel, you're the world's worst friend. Joke's on you. I'm living to 102. Like those old Quaker biddies on the Today Show. And retiring on my winnings. WEASEL Wait, who did you pick? Weasel looks up a the board, where `WADE' has claimed: `BIEBER, J.' WADE The Biebs. But I'm probably wrong. Nothing bad ever happens to teen stars who make 80 mil a year and think they're immune to the pitfalls of addiction and consequence. He'll be fine. (raises shot, yells) Drinks on me, soldiers of fortune! MERCENARIES Hooah! VANESSA Whoa, whoa... Wade turns to see a woman on his other side: VANESSA. Brunette. Silver-blue eyes. Tank. Tiny jean-shorts. VANESSA (CONT'D) Sure you wanna shoot your whole wad? Wade looks Vanessa all the way up and down... then holds up his PINKIE. WADE Tight. Vanessa raises her own pinkie. Shakes like a pinkie swear. VANESSA Vanessa. WADE What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this? BUCK (O.S.) It ain't what she's doing, it's who. BUCK walks past and SLAPS Vanessa on the caboose. (CONTINUED) 25. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 13 CONTINUED: (2) 13 BUCK (CONT'D) I'd hit that shit. Wade pushes back his stool, stands menacingly. WADE Buck, you'd best apologize, before- But Vanessa doesn't wait for Wade's chivalry. She blows right by him and grabs a fistful of Buck's crotch. Buck gasps. WADE (CONT'D) Yeah, that. VANESSA (to Buck) Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf. BUCK I'm sorry! I have no filter between my brain and mouth. I'm working on it. Wade takes Vanessa's shoulders. WADE OK, he apologized... hakuna his tatas... Vanessa lets Buck go, turns on Wade. VANESSA (let's go) And you- (shakes Wade off) Hands off the merchandise. WADE Merchandise? So, what, you, uh, bump fuzzies for money? VANESSA Yup. WADE Rough childhood? VANESSA Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born. WADE Daddy left before I was conceived.

VANESSA I was molested. WADE Me too. Uncle. VANESSA Uncles. They took turns. WADE I watched my own birthday party from the keyhole of a locked closet, which was also my- VANESSA Bedroom? Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box. WADE So you had a dishwasher. I didn't know sleep. It was pretty much 24-7 of ball gags, brownie mix, and fun-house mirrors. VANESSA Who would do such a thing? WADE Hopefully you. Later tonight. (beat) And my Uncle Kevin. Wade EMPTIES the rest of Gavin's wallet: WADE (CONT'D) What can I get for two-hundred-seventy three bucks... and a Yogurtland rewards card? Vanessa shoves the bills into her halter: VANESSA About forty-eight minutes of whatever you want... (peers at card) And a low-fat dessert. (CONTINUED) 27. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 13 CONTINUED: (4) 13 Wade grins at her like a kid on Christmas morning. 14 INT. ARCADE - NIGHT - PAST 14 A two-shot of WADE and VANESSA staring at each other, in profile. Wade looks really excited. WADE Time to put balls... in holes. REVERSE ANGLE to reveal two SKEEBALL MACHINES in the ARCADE. Wade inserts tokens, and balls CLUNK down. Vanessa looks half amused, half weirded out. WADE (CONT'D) You said whatever I want. VANESSA I get it. You love skeeball. Apparently more than you love vagina. WADE Tough call. Just trying to get to know the real you... not the plunging- necklined, short-shorted, two-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood. Wade slowly turns to CAMERA. REVERSE ANGLE TO his P.O.V.: A ten-year-old BOY stops in his tracks, his gaze moving from Vanessa's plunging neckline to her short shorts. BOY Nice tits! VANESSA Thank you, son. (tousles boy's hair) You know how to make a woman feel special. Vanessa reaches down, grabs two balls, hands one to Wade. VANESSA (CONT'D) Balls in holes. WADE Prepare to lose tragically. VANESSA Bring it, big man. (CONTINUED) 28. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 14 CONTINUED: 14 Wade smiles slyly, sizes up the ramp, rears back and OVERHANDS the first ball... right into the 50,000 CUP. VANESSA (CONT'D) Ruh-roh. 15 INT. ARCADE PRIZE COUNTER - LATER - PAST 15 A beaming WADE bellies up to the prize counter and lays a massive armful of pink TICKETS on top. WADE The limited edition Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor. TEEN You're roughly three hundred thousand tickets short. (beat) It's nickel-silver-plated. WADE (disappointed) Then I guess the tire-grade rubber Voltron keychain. VANESSA places a measly TEN tickets of her own next to them. VANESSA And the... pencil eraser. The weary TEEN behind the counter hands Wade the low-rent VOLTRON KEYCHAIN, and Vanessa the eraser. TEEN (reads keychain package copy, bows) You are now the sworn protector of the gentle people of the planet Arus... (re: eraser, positive spin:) And you... you can... erase stuff... written in pencil. Wade extends his arm chivalrously: WADE M'lady? VANESSA Unfortunately, my anus-loving friend, your forty-eight minutes are up. (CONTINUED) 29. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 15 CONTINUED: 15 WADE Arus. And you're more evil than evil King Zarkon himself. Wade rubs his keychain wistfully, then offers it up. WADE (CONT'D) How many more minutes for this? (hard sell) FYI. Five mini lion-bots come together to make up the super-bot. VANESSA (faux-excited) Five mini lion-bots?! (matter-of-fact) Three minutes. WADE (gives keychain up) That's all I'll need! ALT: WADE What do we do with the remaining two minutes thirty seven seconds? VANESSA Cuddle? Vanessa smiles and takes Wade's arm. They walk out of the ARCADE affectionately... ...to the SOUNDS OF TIRELESS, ATHLETIC SEX. 16 EXT./INT. WADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - PAST 16 VANESSA (O.S.) How long can you keep this up? DUCT TAPE fails to cover a big multi-fissured CRACK in the WINDOW of Wade's CRAPPY APARTMENT. Inside, WADE has VANESSA up against the wall decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that have overstayed their welcome and a CALENDAR. They are going at it like RABBITS. WADE (raises eyebrow) All year? (CONTINUED) 30. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 16 CONTINUED: 16 Dolly Parton's `HERE YOU COME AGAIN' kicks in, and we... DISSOLVE INTO: 17 INT. WADE'S APARTMENT - DAY 17 A MONTAGE of images: Fun, irreverent SEX around the CALENDAR between WADE and VANESSA, identified by various holidays. VALENTINE'S DAY SEX. WADE falls back onto a bed covered in rose petals with VANESSA on top of him. She has drawn a heart on his chest in red lipstick. They go at it hard... then pause for a romantic look and kiss. VANESSA Happy Valentine's Day... Then IMMEDIATELY go back to hard pounding. CUT TO: A medium shot of the top half of VANESSA. She is on hands and knees, rocking back and forth. WADE leans into frame from behind. WADE Happy Chinese New Year's... VANESSA (smiles) Year of the Dog. They go at it even harder. SMASH CUT TO: The same exact locked-off medium shot, only WADE is now on hands and knees. His expression betrays great stress. VANESSA leans into frame from behind. VANESSA (CONT'D) Relax... Happy International Women's Day... Wade girds himself, then lets out a surprised, WHIMPERY YELP as some pioneering object journeys into his virgin lands. CUT TO: WADE in bed, legs wrapped around VANESSA's neck, being orally pleasured. (CONTINUED) 31. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 17 CONTINUED: 17 WADE Happy Fourth of July! We see FIREWORKS through the skylight above. CUT TO: WADE sitting in an arm-chair, fully dressed, reading glasses on, purusing a book. VANESSA is reading in a chair opposite, also wearing reading glasses. VANESSA Happy Yom Kippur... (ALT:) Happy Cesar Chavez Day... (ALT:) Happy Lent... (ALT:) Happy Lyme Disease Awareness Day... (ALT:) Happy Wednesday... CUT TO: VANESSA in bed where Wade last was. Now her legs are wrapped around HIS neck, and he's pleasuring her. WADE (muffled) Happy Halloween... VANESSA Oo... ow... WADE (muffled) Sorry. (takes out Vampire teeth) Happy Halloween... Wade goes back to work. CUT TO: WADE and VANESSA banging it out one last time, missionary style. VANESSA Happy Thanksgiving. (ALT:) Happy Wednesday. (CONTINUED) 32. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 17 CONTINUED: (2) 17 Cut WIDE to reveal that they're on top of the KITCHEN TABLE during THANKSGIVING DINNER. Wine spills, cranberry sauce topples, mashed potatoes launch. ALT: BREAKFAST FOOD INSTEAD. Nothing takes away from the joy of the moment. 18 INT. WADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - PAST 18 A CHRISTMAS WREATH hangs on Wade's wall. WADE (O.S.) If your left leg is Thanksgiving, and your right leg is Christmas... WADE strikes a pose, HANDS on HIPS, wearing an AWFUL, AWFUL CHRISTMAS SWEATER. And NO PANTS. VANESSA sits against the bed's HEADBOARD, SHEET pulled over her, up to her chin. She quickly lowers the sheet. Revealing an APPALLING CHRISTMAS SWEATER of her own. WADE (CONT'D) ...can I visit you between the holidays? VANESSA Y'know, red's your color. Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes. Christmas gift! Catch! Vanessa tosses something to Wade. It lands in his hands. WADE Holy fucking shit. It's the nickel-silver-plated Voltron RING, all three hundred thousand tickets worth. VANESSA Limited edition. I had to give the kid behind the counter a rub and tug. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. It was nearly five full months of Skeeball. WADE (beams) Y'know, I've been doing some thinking... VANESSA Really. (CONTINUED) 33. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 18 CONTINUED: 18 WADE ...about why we're so good together. VANESSA Why's that? WADE Your crazy matches my crazy. We're like two jigsaw pieces... weird curvy edges... but fit us together, you can see the picture on top. Wade plants a kiss on Vanessa. She sits up on her knees. VANESSA Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, only `cause you haven't gotten around to asking me- (pregnant pause) Wade, will you- VANESSA (CONT'D) WADE Stick it in my-? Marry me? VANESSA Uhh... jinx? Wade reaches back and pulls out an ENGAGEMENT-RING-LIKE BOX. Vanessa can barely contain her excitement. VANESSA (CONT'D) You're not wearing pants. Where exactly were you hiding that? A vulnerable Wade hands her the box and stands there with the look of... `Open it. Open it!' WADE They say one month's salary. Vanessa opens the box... to reveal a CANDY RING. WADE (CONT'D) Slow month. I've been waiting for this day like Boss Hogg waits to get to the crazy cheesy crust... VANESSA You mean-? WADE I do. (CONTINUED) 34. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 18 CONTINUED: (2) 18 VANESSA That's my line. I love you, Wade Wilson. WADE Thought you charged extra for that. VANESSA I did. At my old job. WADE So that's a-? Vanessa stares. Swallows. Pulls him back into bed and WHISPERS ONE SILENT WORD into his ear ('Yes'). Wade jumps up and DANCES around the room all goofy, POP, LOCK, & ROBOT. VANESSA Easy. I can take it back. Wade dives back into bed, SPOONS with Vanessa, wrapping her in his ARMS, touching his cheek to hers. WADE What if I never let go? VANESSA Just rode a bitch's back, like Yoda on Luke? WADE (contented sigh) `Star Wars' jokes?! VANESSA (corrects) `Empire.' WADE It's like I made you in a computer. Wade swoons, reaches, grabs a POLAROID CAMERA off his night- stand, and holds it at arm's length. WADE (CONT'D) (Yoda voice) Cheese, say! The flash POPS. For this one moment, his life is... WADE (CONT'D) Perfect. Wade hands Vanessa the photo. Then... (CONTINUED) 35. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 18 CONTINUED: (3) 18 WADE (CONT'D) Wee break. ...bounces up to go to the BATHROOM. Vanessa gazes at the photo, which is already FADING IN. Wade notices. WADE (CONT'D) Shake it like a- Uh. You get it. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Here's the thing. Life is an endless series of train-wrecks with only brief, commercial-like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break. Which meant it was time to return... Wade peels off his Christmas sweater... and STEPS CONFIDENTLY BACK TOWARD THE BED. But before he gets there... DEADPOOL (V.O.) ...to our regularly scheduled program. ...HE PASSES OUT, FACE-PLANTING ONTO THE FLOOR. 19 INT. ONCOLOGY WARD - DAY - PAST 19 WADE is sitting in a doctor's office, VANESSA by his side, opposite a solemn ONCOLOGIST. Every image suggests BAD NEWS: A COMPLEX looking MRI IMAGE of the CIRCULATORY SYSTEM on a BACKLIT VIEWING TABLE. SWEAT STAINS under Wade's arms. Vanessa GRIPPING his hand. The LOOK on the DOCTOR's FACE. WADE You're clowning. You're not clowning? I sense clowns. DOCTOR People react to news of late-stage cancer differently. Wade and Vanessa turn and share a devastated but loving look. VANESSA (to doctor, springs into action) So what do we do? Surely there's something... we can... do. I mean, my uncle, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and there was this new experimental drug that- (CONTINUED) 36. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 19 CONTINUED: 19 The VOLUME of Vanessa's voice FADES until we can SEE her talking but no longer hear the words: DEADPOOL (V.O.) See, people do react differently. Vanessa's already working on Plan A. B. All the way to Z. Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it. Or the last. DOCTOR (O.S.) Mr. Wilson? DEADPOOL (V.O.) Believe it or not, this is only the ninth shittiest thing that's ever happened to me. DOCTOR (O.S.) Mr. Wilson? DEADPOOL (V.O.) Stick around. Number 6 is coming right up. DOCTOR Take your time to process this. 20 EXT. FREEWAY - DAY 20 DEADPOOL HAS AJAX PINNED TO THE FREEWAY RAIL. DEADPOOL You know how many people I've killed to find you? AJAX Actually, I do. DEADPOOL So you're aware I've been waiting a long, long time for this. And now I'm finally gonna... (ALT:) So you're aware of the category 5 fuck- storm that's coming. (ALT:) Then you know what's coming. I'm about to do to you what Sugar Ray did to the mid-nineties. A massive SHADOW passes over AJAX and DEADPOOL, accompanied by LOUD METALLIC FOOTSTEPS. Ajax looks up, a bit awed. (CONTINUED) 37. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 20 CONTINUED: 20 Deadpool senses something, reaches back with one hand, feels... ...what turns out to be Colossus's METALLIC CROTCH. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Dad? COLOSSUS GRABS Deadpool's WRIST, CHUCKS him THROUGH the AIR, ASS OVER TEAKETTLE. 21 INT. WADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER - PAST 21 A CLOSE-UP of a Deadpool ACTION FIGURE from `X-Men Origins.' Mouth sewn shut. Blades implanted into wrists. In the exact same POSE we just saw the real Deadpool. Sitting in a nightstand DRAWER in Wade's apartment. WADE (O.S.) This is my most prized possession. Wade looks like he's reaching into the drawer for the action figure, but instead, reaches just UNDER it to grasp Wham!'s `Make it Big' album on Vinyl. He pulls out the album. VANESSA Wham? WADE Wham! (cradles album lovingly) `Make it Big' was the album George and Andy earned their exclamation point. Wade places the album carefully into one of two OPEN SUITCASES on the floor next to him. He is currently going through his possessions, TOSSING OUT the crap and placing the good stuff into the suitcases. Wade pulls out the action figure. WADE (CONT'D) But this. A little piece of me died the day this came out... Wade DUNKS the action figure in the trash can. VANESSA stands opposite, arms crossed, FUMING. VANESSA So I'm s'posed to just... smile and wave you out the door? (CONTINUED) 38. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 21 CONTINUED: 21 WADE Think of it as a spring cleaning. Only if spring was death. (pulls out BERNADETTE PETERS CHANGE PURSE) If I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters. (opens purse, it's full of nickels) Looks like I do. Wade TOSSES the purse toward one of the suitcases. Vanessa's hand stabs out and GRABS it. VANESSA Bernadette's not going anywhere. (slam-dunks purse back into drawer) `Cause you're not going anywhere. WADE Right! The tumors are only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. All the things you can live without. VANESSA You know what I mean. You belong here at home. Surrounded by your Voltron... and your Bernadette... and your me. WADE Babe, we've been through this! Cancer's a real shit-show. A Yakov-Smirnoff- opening-for-the-Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa- State-Fair shit-show. And under no circumstances will I take you to that show. I want you to remember me me. VANESSA Well, I want to remember us us. (that doesn't sound right) We we? WADE I swear, I'll find you in the next life. And boom-box `Careless Whisper' under your window. Wham! VANESSA Are you gonna keep saying it like that? Look, I get this impulse. I do. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 39. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 21 CONTINUED: (2) 21 VANESSA (CONT'D) Before I met you, I used to fantasize about dying alone in the woods, torn apart by wolves. WADE Super fucking bad-ass. VANESSA But that was then, and this is now. Walk out that door. I dare you. I will ride you out. And I won't let go. Yoda on Luke. Vanessa embraces Wade. Tight. Won't let go. A TEAR trickles down Vanessa's CHEEK. VANESSA (CONT'D) (into Wade's ear) If you're willing to fight. There are still options. We'll find them. Together. WADE (smiles) I just realized! I win! My life's officially more fucked-up than yours. VANESSA No one's boom-boxing shit. Vanessa interlaces her pinkie with Wade's. Smiles. VANESSA (CONT'D) What do we we have to lose? WADE Nothing. Everything. Vanessa leans in, and the two start to KISS. 22 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - PAST 22 VANESSA, horizontal, limbs akimbo, ASLEEP in bed. She stirs, feels next to her for Wade. He's NOT THERE. REVEAL WADE standing at the bedroom window. His P.O.V. of the moon makes it look FRACTURED by the cracked glass. RACK FOCUS to Vanessa's REFLECTION. She, too, looks fractured. Wade's eyes well with TEARS at the sight of her. Cancer will steal the one thing that ever mattered. Vanessa's cracked reflection suddenly RAISES its HEAD. (CONTINUED) 40. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 22 CONTINUED: 22 WADE Sorry. Liam Neeson nightmare. I kidnapped his daughter, and he just wasn't having it. Wade slides back into bed. WADE (CONT'D) They've made three of those movies. At some point you wonder if he's just a bad parent. Wade lies on his back. Vanessa nestles her head lovingly against his chest. He takes a vulnerable look at her, then stares at the ceiling, LOST. RS22 INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT RS22 Wade slips quietly out of bed... ...slips on a hoodie and a backpack... ...opens the door... takes one last longing look at Vanessa... ...and slips into the hallway, closing the door behind him. Vanessa is left to feel for Wade in the dark. A22 EXT. STREET - NIGHT A22 WADE walks down the street into the night. He pulls a crumpled card from his jacket pocket: the black card with the recruiter's number. Still walking, Wade pulls out a cellphone and dials. 23 INT. SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST 23 Just another night at SISTER MARGARET'S WAYWARD SCHOOL FOR GIRLS. Regular crowd has shuffled in. Tonight, a bit thin. WADE is bellied up to the bar, disheveled, unkempt, and distraught. WEASEL leans in: WEASEL Jesus. Someone needs a blow-job and a shower. Though courtesy calls for the latter first. (CONTINUED) 41. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 23 CONTINUED: 23 WADE Three shots of Patron Silver, Weez. And a cure to terminal cancer. WEASEL (hands over a green concoction) Fresh out of Patron. Wheatgrass? WADE You're starting to sound like Vanessa... With SHAKY HANDS, Wade empties his POCKETS, placing CRUMPLED BROCHURES on the bar. WADE (CONT'D) She sent away for all these colorful clinic brochures. I hear Chechnya's nice this time of... never. Then there's China... Central Mexico... Know how they say `Cancer' in Spanish? ¡El Cáncer.' Wade pulls out one last thing from his pockets: A POLAROID of HIMSELF and VANESSA. He stares. Weasel notices. WEASEL This belongs on the wall. I want to remember you when you looked... alive. Wade scrapes up a smile as Weasel tapes the picture to the BIG BAR MIRROR. Weasel pours a second wheatgrass shot. Clinks Wade's glass. They throw them back. WINCE. WEASEL (CONT'D) Almost forgot... Weasel slides Wade a distinctive black BUSINESS CARD across the bartop. WEASEL (CONT'D) Guy came in asking for you. Real Grim Reaper type. Wade's gaze follows Weasel's gesture across the barroom, where an ominous MAN in a BLACK SUIT sits ALONE at a table. WEASEL (CONT'D) I don't know? May further the plot? CUT TO: 42. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 23A INT. SISTER'S MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST 23A WADE dead-man-walks to the back of the bar. He passes BOOTHE and BEEF on his way. They nod solemnly, like cops at a funeral procession honoring one of their own. BEEF Wade. Beef offers Wade his shot. Wade eeks out a smile. Throws it back. Then continues on. Wade stops next to the MAN's TABLE. WADE Forget your scythe? The man, even creepier from close up, SMILES. RECRUITER Mr. Wilson. Have a seat. (Wade sits, long pause) I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. WADE Stalker alert. RECRUITER It's my job. Recruitment. And you have quite a reputation. I'm sorry you've had a tough go. But you're a fighter. And not just for Johnny Canuck, impressive as your stint in special forces was. Forty- one confirmed kills? WADE (bitter) One every seven weeks. Same rate most folks get a hair-cut. Wade grabs the recruiter's drink and throws it back. WADE (CONT'D) To wash the taste out. It's hard to forget being so... impressive. RECRUITER Now you spend your days sticking up for the little man, slitting small time throats for small time folks. WADE People change. (CONTINUED) 43. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 23A CONTINUED: 23A The recruiter leans uncomfortably close. RECRUITER (low, conspiratorial) Speaking of which... Mr. Wilson, I represent an organization that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of? WADE I'd say you sound like an infomercial. And not a good infomercial, like Slap Chop. More Shake-Weighty. (jack-off motion) RECRUITER The world needs extraordinary men. We won't just make you better. We'll make you better than better. A super-hero. WADE I already tried the hero business. Let's just say it left a mark. The only chance you'll see me again is if I hit `fuck- it.' 24 EXT./INT. GUADALAJARAN CLINIC WAITING ROOM - DAY - PAST 24 A DILAPIDATED, SKETCHY MEDICAL `CLINIC' haunts the cityscape in GUADALAJARA, MEXICO. WADE (V.O.) For now, I'll get through this with the one I love. A sickly-looking WADE is on the final stop in his futile quest to find a cure. DESPERATE. Among the MOST DESPERATE. He sits in a pathetic muzak-filled WAITING ROOM. Wearing a SOMBRERO and clutching VANESSA's hand. Her fingers are interlaced in his, once perfectly manicured nails chewed to the quick. Vanessa is also wearing a SOMBRERO, and ANXIETY on her face. Wade COUGHS SEVERELY, REPEATEDLY into a HANDKERCHIEF. Wade turns to the sweet ELDERLY COUPLE sitting next to him, ekes out a smile. The old man plays with some WORRY BEADS. (CONTINUED) 44. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 24 CONTINUED: 24 WADE (pulls out Spanish-English electronic translator) De donde eres? ELDERLY WOMAN Boca Raton. WADE Ah. The fancy part of Mexico. ELDERLY MAN We've moved in with my son. To afford the treatment. Wade looks pained to hear this. WADE Cancer? Sorry - ¿El Cáncer? ELDERLY MAN Stage four. WADE Toughest part of the Tour de France. VANESSA Very hilly. The elderly man gestures to the souvenir PATCHES sewn onto Wade's `HELLO KITTY' DUFFEL: CHECHNYA. CHINA. INDONESIA. ELDERLY MAN Logging some frequent flier miles? WADE (bone-weary) Final stop on Desperation World Tour, 2016, which I believe was also the name of the Stones' last concert... VANESSA `Final' because this is where we find the cure. A MOTHER and her stoic young SON sign in with the NURSE behind the front desk. The boy has lost all his HAIR. NURSE No cheques de viajero. No pesos. Cash. Americano. (CONTINUED) 45. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 24 CONTINUED: (2) 24 Wade grows upset as the mother counts out hard-earned CASH. The boy reaches for a BOX filled with CHUPACHUPS (lollipops). The nurse scolds: NURSE (CONT'D) Chupachups cuestan extra! WADE (O.S.) (angry) Hey! The nurse looks coldly at Wade. He stares back, eyes hard, then gets up and lays a crumpled dollar on the counter. WADE (CONT'D) (ice cold) It's on me. The nurse blinks, then stands, checking a CHART. NURSE Señor... Abe Solomon? ABE and his WIFE get up. The nurse motions for Mrs. Solomon to stay in the waiting room. ABE (to Wade and Vanessa) Handsome couple. Good luck to you two. Abe drops his WORRY BEADS. Wade bends to retrieve them, then stands with effort and gently hands them to Abe. WADE Good luck to you, Pops. Wade sits back down, and his eyes find the LITTLE BOY: his SUNKEN EYES. His MISSING HAIR. His LOLLIPOP, CLUTCHED like the richest treasure. Wade turns to look at Vanessa, who's also staring at the boy. Even though Vanessa is healthy, she, too, looks sick. No makeup. Dirty hair. Dark circles under her eyes. When she looks at Wade, it's clear she, not he, most needs comfort. Wade pulls Vanessa close and strokes her hair with a trembling hand. Abe disappears. Wade watches with a newly dark look of suspicion. 46. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 25 INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY - PAST 25 ABE lies shirtless on an UNSANITARY operating table, a tray of RUSTY surgical KNIVES nearby. A MAN with a pock-marked face stands over him in a white lab coat with blue-stitched cursive writing: `Dr. Delgado.' DOCTOR Buenos días, Señor Abe. `Doctor' Delgado pokes and prods with his fingers, as if Abe's mid-section is Play-Doh. DOCTOR (CONT'D) Voy a llegar dentro de tu cuerpo. ABE I'm sorry. No hablo español, doc. The doctor's other hand dips below the table, comes up dripping with something bloody. He kneeds at wrinkled skin smearing the CHICKEN BLOOD across Abe's flesh. DOCTOR De que se cure! Señor Abe, you are cured. The doctor holds SMELLING SALTS under Abe's nose. His closed eyes jerk open to see the doctor's gloved hand CLUTCHING a huge, bloody `TUMOR.' Abe pushes himself up, peers down at his bloody abdomen with awe. The doctor wipes the blood away and helps him up. ABE (tearing up) Thank you. I owe you my life. As Abe shuffles out, the doctor turns away to dump the `tumor' in the trash and wash his bloody hands in a basin. DOCTOR (over his shoulder) ¡Proximo! Next! WADE (O.S.) Already here, hombre. Dr. Delgado nearly JUMPS at the sight of WADE, already standing in the OPEN DOOR of the room, looking DANGEROUS. (CONTINUED) 47. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 25 CONTINUED: 25 DOCTOR So sorry, you surprise me. How... long... you standing there, Señor? Wade walks slowly TOWARD the doctor, who steps out nervously from BEHIND his table. The two stand face-to-face. Wade smiles... angles his foot UNDER the OPERATING TABLE... ...and uses it to SLIDE something out from underneath the table: a BUCKET of BLOODY CHICKEN GIZZARDS that double as removed `tumors.' Wade's RAGE seems to grow by the INSTANT. WADE Long enough... Delgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rusty SCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. Delgado LUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS. Wade TACKLES him. In Wade's weakened state, the fight becomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The BUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop. The doctor squirms out of Wade's grasp and crawls into the hallway. Wade wriggles after him, tugging at his ankle. 26 INT. WAITING ROOM / HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST 26 The MUZAC still plays. VANESSA smiles warmly/sadly at the little BOY, who is unwrapping his CHUPACHUP. Suddenly... a SCREAM and cries for help in Spanish. The NURSE and an ALARMED VANESSA rush toward the shouting. 27 INT. HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST 27 At last, WADE's fury has overcome his physical weakness. He straddles the DOCTOR's CHEST. His expression is that of a man who's LOSING his SHIT. Wade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor's throat, then STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles, and falls still. Chest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR END of the HALL: VANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyes with her and swims back up into SANITY... `What have I done?' This is a horrific glimpse into Wade's murderous past... ...and the look on Vanessa's face is one of HORROR and PAIN. (CONTINUED) 48. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 27 CONTINUED: 27 Awash in shame, Wade staggers to his feet, slips on chicken blood, and LUNGES in the other direction. He hits the door at the end of the hall at a RUN. 28 STAB! 28 The sword, covered in BLOOD, penetrates the crayon drawing of the recruiter on DEADPOOL's CORKBOARD. DEADPOOL Thank you, Agent Smith. Deadpool lasers in on AJAX's picture at the top of the pyramid. 29 EXT. GUADALAJARA STREET - SUNSET - PAST 29 WADE leans against a wall, gasping for breath. He looks back toward her voice, face a mask of pain. Instead of seeking her... he melts into the busy street. 30 EXT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY 30 DEADPOOL trudges to his FRONT DOOR. He speaks to the AUDIENCE: DEADPOOL Some kind of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said... when it comes time to licking wounds... there's no place like home, and I share that home with someone you met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al. She's like Robin to my Batman. Except she's old. And black. And blind. POPS INSIDE DEADPOOL (V.O.) And I think she loves me. Wait... pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too. 31 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST 31 WADE, ghastly, nearing death, lies BACK onto a STRETCHER, covered only by a FLIMSY HOSPITAL GOWN. He's being wheeled down a dim corridor by two tough-looking ORDERLIES. In one hand, he holds the recruiter's crumpled BUSINESS CARD. In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING, as tight as his shaky hand allows. (CONTINUED) 49. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 31 CONTINUED: 31 They turn a corner and push through a pair of double doors into a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for a new life. Immediately, every single thing he sees/hears begins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands just inside the doors, smiling. RECRUITER (O.S.) Mr. Wilson! Nothing warms my heart like a change of someone else's. Walking into Wade's P.O.V. is the creepy RECRUITER. He beams down on Wade. RECRUITER (CONT'D) You finally hit `fuck-it.' WADE Worse. Just promise you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else. RECRUITER Of course. WADE Oh, and please don't make my super suit green. Or animated. RECRUITER I hope you enjoy your stay. The `Workshop,' as this old warehouse is affectionately called, has been converted into a working LABORATORY. Wade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows of individual `tents,' each containing a SUBJECT. Wade's eyes DART to helpless SILHOUETTES. We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS. A FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man named CUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on another STRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but quickly moves on by. Wade can't help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham's eyes. The tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights. Wade spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. Wade is wheeled into the tent that's his new home. The FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATING TABLE and roughly STRAPS him down. (CONTINUED) 50. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 31 CONTINUED: (2) 31 WADE Um. My first request? A warmer table. (shivers) And warmer hands. Wade DOUBLE-TAKES at the sight of the figure above him: ANGEL DUST - thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic - an Amazonian warrior in another age. Angel Dust wheels over a high-tech I.V. DRIP, complete with glass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID. Then she roughly straps Wade's NECK to the table. Wade nearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face. WADE (CONT'D) Easy! Aren't you a little strong for a lady? I'm calling wang. ANGEL DUST You'd like that, huh. Welcome to our little hospital. WADE It doesn't look like a hospital. It looks like Chlamydia holding still. An UNLIT MATCHSTICK protrudes from Angel Dust's teeth - her idea of a TOOTHPICK. WADE (CONT'D) Oral fixation? ANGEL DUST Shut. The fuck. Up. Angel Dust places a FINGER on Wade's FOREHEAD and SHOVES his head back against the table - BANG - pinning it there. AJAX (O.S.) Patience, Angel. All in good time. Enter AJAX, whom we know as the PRISONER from the RAFT with whom we've seen Deadpool tangle in the PRESENT. This is the first Ajax and Wade have met. WADE Can I expect turndown serv-? Ajax nods to Angel Dust. BOOM! She GAGS Wade with SURGICAL TUBING, then wraps it around the TABLE, immobilizing his head. (CONTINUED) 51. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 31 CONTINUED: (3) 31 AJAX You're a talker. Wade's eyes are wider than ever. WTF? AJAX (CONT'D) (disarmingly matter-of-fact) Mr. Wilson, my name is Ajax. I manage the Workshop. My `welcome' speech used to be full of euphemisms like `You may feel some discomfort.' But I've grown blunt. Ajax unsheathes an I.V. NEEDLE. Angel Dust up-tilts the table 45 degrees, then readies a holographic monitor. AJAX (CONT'D) The Workshop is not a government program. It's a private institution tasked with turning reclamation projects like yourself into men of extraordinary abilities. I'm about to remake your life. But if you think cancer cures painlessly, you're wrong. If you think super-human powers are acquired painlessly, you're wrong. Ajax touches Wade with the I.V. NEEDLE, pressing here and there, not QUITE hard enough to break skin. At last, he locates the subclavian vein. Wade flinches. AJAX (CONT'D) We're injecting you with a serum that activates mutant genes. For it to work, we need to subject you to extreme stress. The liquid glows FLUORESCENT through Wade's white skin as it pumps into the pulmonary highway. AJAX (CONT'D) You've heard the whole make-an-omelette, break-some-eggs bit? (Wade blinks) I'm about to hurt you, Wade. The kind of hurt I can't describe and you can't prepare for. It's cruel stuff. And there's no way out for you. No secret you can tell me. No soft spot in me to appeal to. Wade stares at them in shock. (CONTINUED) 52. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 31 CONTINUED: (4) 31 ANGEL DUST What, you expected Weapon X? Ajax starts to TURN AWAY, but stops. AJAX One more thing. What's the ad? `I'm not just the president. I'm a client?' I've been through this procedure myself. It made me stronger. It also scorched my nerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. In fact... (smiles) I no longer feel anything. Wade reacts by SAYING something - made UNINTELLIGIBLE by the surgical tubing. Ajax nods to Angel Dust, who slices the SURGICAL TUBING, SNAPPING it away and FREEING Wade to TALK. WADE Something in your teeth. Ajax smiles WITHOUT opening his mouth, signals Angel Dust. She slams Wade's head back again as he turns to leave. Before he exits, Ajax hesitates, can't help but check his teeth in one of the surgical mirrors. WADE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Made you look! Hey, is Ajax your real name? `Cause it sounds suspiciously made up. What's it really? Steve? Mark? Trevor? Kyle? (E.T. voice) Elliot? We hear LAUGHS from nearby tents. Wade is now playing for an audience. AJAX Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor. WADE We'll see! AJAX (to Angel Dust) All yours. We re-take WADE'S P.O.V. as Angel Dust, chewing her matchstick, re-enters frame above him, smiles, then punches him in the face. Black. 53. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 32 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT/DAY - MONTAGE - PAST 32 A MONTAGE of Wade's treatments in the Workshop, set to the notes of JOHN DENVER's inspirational classic, `I WANT TO LIVE.' Juxtaposed with HARROWING VIGNETTES of Angel Dust and AJAX experimenting on WADE... ...as he GASPS, CLAWS, SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER. Wade is DUNKED into thick, molasses-like LIQUID. PULLED and YANKED, POKED and PRODDED by contraptions that would have shamed the Spanish Inquisition. SAWED. COMPRESSED. SLICED. DICED. SLAP-CHOPPED. BLED. LONG SYRINGES PLUNGE DEEP INTO SOFT TISSUE. SCALPELS MAKE LONG INCISIONS. ENDOSCOPIC CAMERAS TRAVEL THROUGH THE BODY, REVEALING THE DIRTY WORK OF INVASIVE SURGICAL EQUIPMENT. STAPLE-GUNS DRIVE STAPLES INTO SLICED SKIN TO PULL IT BACK TOGETHER. MINIATURE CIRCULAR SAWS SLICE THROUGH BONE. IV's PULL FLUIDS FROM THE BODY AND INSERT OTHER FLUIDS IN. JOHN DENVER I want to share what I can give. I want to be... I want to live! We also see SHORT, ULTRA-FAST MINI-MONTAGES of medical instruments, implying the PASSAGE of TIME. 32AA INT. WORKSHOP - MONTAGE - NIGHT 32AA Over images of: INJECTION: AJAX (V.O.) The serum I'm injecting you with targets any mutant genes lurking in your DNA. TORTURE: AJAX (V.O.) Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so we must subject you to extreme stress. (CONTINUED) 54. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 32AA CONTINUED: 32AA AJAX (V.O.) If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate and manifest in spectacular fashion. AJAX (V.O.) If not, we'll have no choice but to keep hurting you in new and different ways. Each more painful than the last. 32AA INT. WORKSHOP - DAY 32AA AJAX Until you finally mutate. Or die. 33 INT. WORKSHOP - WADE'S TENT / WORM'S TENT - NIGHT 33 At last, Wade is laid back down on his table, only now in QUIET DARKNESS, MEEK, WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE whatever. CUNNINGHAM (O.S.) Puppies. In the tent NEXT to Wade, CUNNINGHAM holds up his FIST to the fabric. Wade can see it through the cloth in SILHOUETTE. CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D) It helps picturing puppies. Wade gives Cunningham a KNUCKLE BUMP through the fabric. WADE Puppies. CUNNINGHAM Or kittens. If you swing that way. WADE (chuckles) I swing both ways. Wade swallows hard, grows serious: WADE (CONT'D) But me, I've been making a list of things I still plan to do. CUNNINGHAM A bucket list? (CONTINUED) 55. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 33 CONTINUED: 33 WADE I prefer fuck-it list: Naked tandem base- jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs... Sparking up a spliff with the Olympic torch... CUNNINGHAM Finishing my Lego Millenium Falcon... WADE Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven... CUNNINGHAM Making my kids banana pancakes... AJAX (O.S.) With the mouse ears? Creative, and delicious. AJAX and ANGEL DUST enter CUNNINGHAM's tent and begin prepping him for a fresh round of torture. AJAX (CONT'D) It's OK, I encourage distractions. Can't have you giving up on us, can we now, you little worm? Suddenly, a VOICE calls out from the adjacent tent: WADE (O.S.) Don't take that shit, Cunningham! How tough can he be? Name like Francis. Ajax is very subtly SURPRISED. WHAT did Wade just say? WADE is still strapped down inside. Talking nice and LOUD: WADE (CONT'D) That's right! He got `Ajax' off a dish- washing liquid! (laughs from nearby tents) Legal name's Francis. F-R-A-N-C-I-oops. Ajax has ENTERED Wade's tent. Ajax's expression tells us all we need to know about the validity of Wade's claim. With as much freedom of motion as he has in one hand, Wade WAVES a STUB of PAPER at Francis. WADE (CONT'D) Dry-cleaning tag, Francis. Snagged it off your lab coat. (beat) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 56. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 33 CONTINUED: (2) 33 WADE (CONT'D) FYI. I may be able to get you the super- hero discount. CLOSE-UP on the tag, which reads `FREEMAN, FRANCIS.' Ajax stares hard at Wade with menacing eyes. AJAX You are so relentlessly annoying. Shut the fuck up, or I'll sew that pretty mouth shut. WADE Uh, I wouldn't do that. Here's the problem with round-the-clock torture. You can't really step it up from there. AJAX Is that what you think? WADE Yeah. Francis. That's what I think. 34 OMITTED 34 V35 EXT/INT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS V35 35 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST 35 Two ORDERLIES and ANGEL DUST finish strapping Wade down and attaching ELECTRODES to his head and chest. Wade is BOUND to a HOSPITAL BED that's ENCASED in a large CAPSULE of PLEXIGLAS. The top half of the capsule is hinged to one side, OPEN, allowing Angel Dust access to Wade. Ajax sits eating a meal from some Tupperware in a nearby chair. AJAX Seems your genes are as stubborn as you. But we can still increase your suffering. We don't even have a name for this next toy. Various WIRES and TUBES run out of the capsule, connected to OXYGEN TANKS, DIALS, and a MONITOR tracking BRAIN and HEART. AJAX (CONT'D) We reduce the oxygen in the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 57. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 35 CONTINUED: 35 AJAX (CONT'D) If you start to pass out, and your brain waves slow, we turn up the O2. If you catch your breath, and your heart rate slows, we turn it back down. And we leave you. Right. There. WADE Um. What? AJAX Waterboarding is the most severe stress known to man. This device prolongs that stress. For hours, days, weeks... Angel Dust chews her match and TAPS the capsule with a FINGER. ANGEL DUST Or if you keep yapping, years... WADE And I thought you were dicks before this. AJAX The saddest part? You still think we're making you a super-hero. You. Dishonorable discharge. Beating up pizza guys. Hip deep in hookers. You're nothing. I'd call you an asshole, but I'd have to answer to assholes. Little secret, Wade. The Workshop doesn't make super-heroes. It makes super-slaves. We're gonna fit you for a control collar and auction you to the highest bidder. (finishes meal, gets up) Who knows what they'll force you to do. Put down freedom fighters. Murder innocents. Or maybe just mow a lawn or two. ANGEL DUST There's a brave face. Ajax goes to close the lid. WADE Seriously. Now you do have something in your teeth. AJAX Enjoy the weekend! (CONTINUED) 58. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 35 CONTINUED: (2) 35 Ajax swings the capsule CLOSED and LOCKS it. The sound leaks away until all that's left is a HISSING SOUND as AJAX hits BUTTONS to lower O2 LEVELS. Wade's voice drops out as his breathing suddenly grows SHORT and SHALLOW. The oxygen dials fall. His HEART-RATE SOARS. ANGEL DUST (chuckles) He looks like a turd in a punch-bowl. AJAX (bright idea) The `Punch-Bowl!' Wade fights off panic. His breaths become desperate GASPS. There's not enough air to talk, or even SCREAM. DISSOLVE TO: 35A INT. WORKSHOP TENT - LATER 35A Night. Eerily DARK, SILENT. An extreme CLOSE-UP of Wade's hand, nails clenched into the surface of whatever he's lying on. Is his skin... actually BUBBLING? Two MEN enter the tent and stand over the PUNCH-BOWL. CLICK. One of the men turns on a surgical light overhead, revealing himself to be a KINDLY-looking DOCTOR, avuncular, thick glasses. Next to him is an ORDERLY. The doctor peers through the Punch-Bowl's lid. He is SURPRISED by what he sees. He nods to the orderly: `Go on, hurry.' The orderly quickly unlocks and unlatches the lid, then swings it OPEN. Air RUSHES INTO the PUNCH-BOWL. The orderly steps away, leaving the doctor alone in the room. WADE, hidden in darkness, gasps as though surfacing after being held underwater. The doctor casts a SHADOW over WADE's face inside. The doctor is FASCINATED, ENLIVENED. DOCTOR Mr. Wilson... these results are remarkable. Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR. (CONTINUED) 59. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 35A CONTINUED: 35A DOCTOR (CONT'D) Your cancer cells are more aggressive than ever. Dividing and metastasizing at a fantastic rate. WADE (broken, breathless) Yippee. DOCTOR But... the cells have inalterably changed. They're no longer destructive, but productive, selectively targeting and replacing damaged tissue. WADE That was a lot of... what's the word... syllables. Are you saying I'm better? DOCTOR Better than better. A miracle. WADE (weak smile) My Mom used to call me that. (ALT:) Me and Jesus. (beat, to doctor) Thank you. I owe you my life. Wade grows choked up. The doctor is taken with empathy and affection. He tenderly brushes the hair off Wade's forehead, of which the camera catches the tiniest glimpse. Wade's skin is not RIGHT somehow. DOCTOR There. There. Your journey's been long and difficult. But you've become something extraordinary. Just rest now. Rest. The doctor slowly exits. Wade lies there. Actually relaxes. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Then, just when I thought I could breathe easy... Who appears over the PUNCH-BOWL but... ...AJAX. (CONTINUED) 60. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 35A CONTINUED: (2) 35A AJAX Oo. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king. WADE You f-fucking sadistic- AJAX No. Not fair. Everything I've done to you has been in your best interest. Even this next bit. You may be cured, but you still need to learn to be a better man. Polite. Respectful. What better way to teach you than to close this lid... and keep torturing you stupid. Ajax SLAMS the lid shut, LATCHES and LOCKS it. The hissing resumes. Wade's eyes grow wide. He starts to slip-slide toward absolute ANGUISH. DEADPOOL (V.O.) If you think I'm losing my marbles `cause I can't breathe. You're only half right. Ajax appears to be looking in at Wade. But we RACK FOCUS to reveal he's looking at his REFLECTION in the Plexiglas lid, checking for stuff between his teeth. DEADPOOL (V.O.) See, if Francis was able to see his reflection... The camera SWINGS around to Wade's POINT-OF-VIEW of Ajax through the glass lid, which has been newly ILLUMINATED by the surgical light above... ...and then RACKS FOCUS to WADE's REFLECTED FACE. Covered with HORRIFIC SCARS. Wade is no longer a handsome young man. He is a monster. Which is perfectly visible to him one foot away. DEADPOOL (V.O.) You know what they say. You always remember your first time. Wade throws back his head in a SILENT SCREAM. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Even 5 years later... 61. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 36 EXT./INT. SCRAP-YARD / GROUND - DAY - PRESENT 36 Back in the PRESENT, we find ourselves in a huge SCRAP-YARD, where various ships, planes, etc. are sold for scrap iron. Among various vehicles is an OLD, BATTERED COMBAT CARRIER, long given up for dead. A heavy truck navigates through the heaps of scrap-metal and grinds to a stop in front of the carrier. Two heavyset MEN climb down and head toward the back of the truck, heave the heavy door open. AJAX and ANGEL DUST stand just inside, boxes and gear piled up behind them. They hop down as four more rough-looking men pile out behind them. Angel Dust drags out a WOODEN CRATE. The planks crunch as she digs her fingers into the wood and heaves it up on one burly shoulder as if it weighed no more than a sack of flour. Heavy AMMO peeks through. ANGEL DUST Better to be the hunter than the hunted. Ajax and Angel Dust walk across the muddy yard toward a service elevator bolted to the rusting hulk of the carrier. AJAX Either I kill him, or he kills me. Let's put him out of our misery... VA37 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY VA37 DEADPOOL lays horizontal. He is speaking to the AUDIENCE: DEADPOOL There... all caught up. He CLIMBS up and out of the GARBAGE TRUCK. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (yells to driver) Thanks for the lift! Apologies if I bled in the recyclables. 37 INT./EXT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY - PRESENT 37 A mid-city DUPLEX. Borderline ghetto. Semi-furnished, `first apartment' quality: futons and torchiere lamps. (CONTINUED) 62. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 37 CONTINUED: 37 Stained carpet, currently being swept by a roaming ROOMBA. IKEA... everywhere. The same old AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN we glimpsed early in the movie - late 70's - purple floral dress - sits on a ratty couch, where the typical old woman might KNIT. Instead, this old woman uses a BOX-CUTTER to lay waste to a BIG CARDBOARD BOX from IKEA - the `IVAR SHELVING UNIT.' She lays out its components and tools on a wobbly IKEA NORNAS COFFEE TABLE... ...made more difficult by the fact that she is completely BLIND. This is Deadpool's roommate, BLIND AL. Suddenly, Blind Al's KEEN EAR picks up a faint, distant KNOCKING. She cocks her head to LISTEN. 38 EXT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY - PRESENT 38 ANGLE ON THE FRONT YARD: Dirt. No grass. `93 Chevy Avon up on BLOCKS. An exhausted DEADPOOL is slumped against his own front door, red suit, no mask, no right HAND. He is KNOCKING weakly on the door with the SIDE of his HEAD. 39 INT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY - PRESENT 39 ANGLE ON THE LIVING ROOM: BLIND AL stands up in comfy creme nursing shoes. Grabs her red-tipped CANE. And shuffles toward the front door... ...when she is TRIPPED by the ROOMBA. She FACE-PLANTS. DEADPOOL (O.S.) (from outside) Let's get ready to Rooooooomba! BLIND AL (under breath) Ass-hat. Al SWINGS her cane angrily, again and again, trying to hit the robotic vacuum, which moves happily just out of reach. She reaches her knees and stretches for the door when... ...DEADPOOL SPRINGS it open from outside, SLAMMING it into her HEAD. Blind Al goes down again. (CONTINUED) 63. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 39 CONTINUED: 39 DEADPOOL Morning, roomie! (sniffs) This place reeks like old lady pants. BLIND AL (still supine) Yes. I'm old. I wear pants. DEADPOOL But you're no lady. Blind Al struggles to a sitting position. Deadpool walks past her in his socks, drops his muddy BOOTS to the floor and slips into a pair of POWDER-BLUE CROCS parked just inside the door. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) So comfy. BLIND AL Upside of being blind: I've never seen you in Crocs. DEADPOOL You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes? BLIND AL Yes I know. Downside of being blind: I hear everything in this duplex. Deadpool walks bitterly past one wall of the DUPLEX, which is COVERED - WALL-to-WALL, FLOOR-to-CEILING, with CHRISTMAS ADVENT CALENDARS. Tons of ornaments/candies/etc. adorn the calendars. There's not ONE CALENDAR left uncovered. DEADPOOL One-thousand eight-hundred twenty-two ornaments pinned to two-hundred-sixty calendars. All for a `Christmas' that... never... came! BLIND AL Too much naughty, too little nice. DEADPOOL Sit on a stick. DEADPOOL SPLAYS OUT on a white futon, MOANING, nursing his horrifying wound. (CONTINUED) 64. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 39 CONTINUED: (2) 39 BLIND AL Bactine? DEADPOOL (dripping sarcasm) Yeah. Bactine should do it. How's the Kullen coming? IKEA doesn't assemble itself. Blind Al sits back on the ratty couch and begins applying the finishing touches to the shelving unit. BLIND AL You're telling me. I don't mind the Kullen. It's an improvement on the Hurdal. DEADPOOL Anything's an improvement on the Hurdal. I'd have taken a Hemnes... or even a Trysil... over the Hurdal. But I didn't get excited `til I saw the Kullen. BLIND AL Screw please. DEADPOOL Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades for you. BLIND AL You'd be surprised. DEADPOOL And totally grossed out! Blind Al turns the final screw, beyond unenthusiastic. BLIND AL Ta. Dah. The dresser look like the Leaning Tower of Piza in shitty particle board. Deadpool TOSSES a DIRTY MAGAZINE on top. The Kullen COLLAPSES. BLIND AL (CONT'D) I wish I'd never heard of Craig's List. DEADPOOL And I quote: `Looking for roommate. Blind to life's imperfections. Must be good with hands.' Or wouldya rather I build IKEA and you pay rent? (CONTINUED) 65. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 39 CONTINUED: (3) 39 BLIND AL Why such a douche this morning? DEADPOOL Let's recap. That cock-thistle who turned me into this freak... the one I've been waiting five years for... slipped through my arms today. Arm. Deadpool holds up his previously severed arm, which now has a little tweenage ARM emerging off it. Yes. Deadpool can GROW BACK LIMBS. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Catching him was my only chance to be hot again. Get my super-sexy ex back. And stop the same shit from happening to anyone else. So yeah, things are pretty fucking scrumptious. Deadpool stands. Walks behind the couch, and as he passes the back of Blind Al's head... FARTS. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Hash-tag Drive-by. BLIND AL (to herself) I'm gonna find this `Craig.' And I'm gonna kill him. DEADPOOL Once I've got the cure, I'm gonna do the same to Francis... RS40 INT. WORKSHOP TENT - LATER RS40 WADE, newly scarred, hidden in darkness, continues to GASP as though being held underwater. Then the lid on the punch-bowl SLIDES BACK, revealing AJAX. Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR. Ajax leans in for a closer look. AJAX Bloody hell. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king. WADE (can barely speak) What have you done to me?! AJAX You give me too much credit. This... this is the result of your genes. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 66. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 RS40 CONTINUED: RS40 AJAX (CONT'D) The punch bowl merely raised your stress to trigger the mutation. WADE You... sadistic... fuck! AJAX Where's the gratitude?! You're cured! Your mutated cells can heal anything. They're attacking the cancer as fast as it can form. Your insides are a war zone. Not to mention your outsides! Wade looks stunned as he struggles to process all this information. Ajax smiles down. AJAX (CONT'D) I've seen similar side-effects before. I could cure them for you. But really, where's the fun in that? Wade says nothing, hating him but wanting to believe. AJAX (CONT'D) I'm going to close this lid again. Maybe you no longer need it. But I do. For a long moment, Wade stares intensely at Ajax and sees... nothing, a black hole of empathy. And he knows this is a man who will never stop hurting him. ***NOTE: We will not be reshooting the rest of the scene below with the exception of the final shot.**** So he turns his gaze to the ceiling and WITHDRAWS into himself... the one place the cruelty can no longer reach him. Angel Dust enters, chewing on her usual matchstick. AJAX He's all yours. Angel leans over the Punch-bowl, starts to undo Wade's restraints. ANGEL You smell like shit. When Angel Dust leans close to Wade's head he suddenly comes alive and uses the strength he has left to HEAD-BUTT her in the FOREHEAD. (CONTINUED) 67. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 CONTINUED: AJAX (impressed) Whoa. Angel advances toward Wade. Ajax stops her. AJAX (CONT'D) Hey, hey, alright. It's alright. I think he earned that one, yeah? You take off. Go on... off you go. As Angel Dust EXITS the tent, she reaches to her mouth for her matchstick... only it's not there. She frowns, fishes another match from her pocket, and tucks it between her lips. Ajax finishes strapping Wade back down and goes to close the lid. AJAX (CONT'D) One question. What's my name? Wade remains listless, mouth SHUT. BLINKS. AJAX (CONT'D) Didn't think so. Ajax CLOSES and LOCKS the lid. HISS. The oxygen DIALS FALL. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Sorry, Francis. But my lips are sealed. And then we're inside the punch bowl with Wade as the oxygen levels drop and the suffering rises. Through a fog of misery Wade sees Ajax staring down, watching him, drinking in his pain. 41 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST 41 Back in the Punch-Bowl, Wade OPENS his MOUTH... within which he was HIDING a SINGLE MATCHSTICK, clenched carefully - dryly - between his teeth. He inhales... then SPITS OUT the match into his waiting PALM. Finally, he STRIKES it against the side of the Punch Bowl. Wade aims the now FLAMING match toward the tiny HOLE through which OXYGEN flows. The match is quickly burning down. Will it reach the hole before it snuffs out? At the last possible moment... ...the flame COMBUSTS the stream of oxygen, IGNITING it... (CONTINUED) 68. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 41 CONTINUED: 41 ...back through the TRANSPARENT PLASTIC TUBE that trails outside the Punch-Bowl. The flame SNAKES through the tube, this way and that, until it reaches the OXYGEN TANK standing next to the Punch-Bowl. A beat. Then the TANK EXPLODES. The BLOWS APART. The hospital bed SNAPS in TWO. Out in the ward, the FIREBALL curls outward, spreading from TENT to TENT. BOOM! BOOM! Other flammable tanks DETONATE. The tents GO UP like ROMAN CANDLES. It's now MASS CHAOS. ALARMS BLARE. Flames LEAP. Smoke BILLOWS. Patients FLEE. A CURTAIN of FIRE suddenly DISPERSES, replaced by billowy WHITE SMOKE from an OVER-SIZED CHROME FIRE EXTINGUISHER... ...held by AJAX, who STRIDES grimly toward Wade's tent. He throws back the burning fabric... ...and nearly EATS an OXYGEN TANK. He BLOCKS it at the last moment with his FIRE EXTINGUISHER. CLANG. On the other end of the oxygen tank, WIND-MILLING it with unbridled FEROCITY, is WADE. WADE and AJAX SWING the oxygen tank and fire extinguisher like modern day CLUBS, trying to take off each other's heads. CLANG! BANG! BAM! The tanks COLLIDE in mid-air. Ajax's fingers CRUNCH between metal. He doesn't even feel it. Wade grabs the HOSE of Ajax's fire extinguisher, angles it up, and gets his finger on the TRIGGER. The extinguisher BLASTS. Ajax is momentarily BLINDED. Wade brings the oxygen tank down like a LUMBERJACK'S AXE. Ajax BLOCKS it, but is driven to his KNEES. Wade's eyes are lit with fire. DOWN the tank COMES, again and AGAIN. Ajax takes his own fire extinguisher to the CHIN. Then catches a BLOW from the oxygen TANK to his TEMPLE. The extinguisher goes FLYING. Wade swings the OXYGEN TANK AGAIN, but against all odds, AJAX CATCHES it and SLAMS it back into Wade's NOSE. CRUNCH. (CONTINUED) 69. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 41 CONTINUED: (2) 41 Ajax rises to his feet, and the two grip OPPOSITE SIDES of the OXYGEN TANK, GRAPPLING with every ounce of strength. Wade sweeps Ajax's feet and he topples over backwards, Wade on top of him. Wade lifts the heavy tank and slams it into his face. Once. Twice. Three times. CRACK. As he's about to finish the job Ajax smiles, blood bubbling from his smashed lips. AJAX You can't kill me, Wade. I'm the only one who can fix that ugly mug. Wade looks torn as his rage gives way to something like hope. He tosses the tank away. WADE Then time to make me me again. A scream of terror behind Wade makes Wade turn. CUNNINGHAM (O.S.) Wade! Help! Wade! Wade looks through the smoke and flame and spies a helpless Cunningham lying in the flaming wreckage. WADE Fuck! Wade drops Ajax and SPRINTS to Cunningham, starts dragging at the WRECKAGE trapping him, when... SLICE! A long piece of sheared REBAR THRUSTS CLEAN THROUGH his CHEST from BEHIND. The force sends the spear DEEP into the wooden floor beams, pinning Wade like an insect in an entomologist's display. In a grand display of strength, AJAX BENDS the end of the rebar to keep Wade pinned... then walks around and squats down into Wade's eye line, wearing a triumphant sneer. AJAX Say it. `Francis.' Blood dribbles from Wade's mouth as he tries in vain to push himself off the bloody spike of metal. Ajax rises, scans the burning workshop with a scowl - clearly a lost cause - and turns to leave. Cunningham screams again as the flames near him. Grunting with the pain and effort Wade tries to push himself off the spike. (CONTINUED) 70. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 41 CONTINUED: (3) 41 His hands slip on the blood-slick metal, and he cannot free himself. His VOLTRON RING lies on the floor next to him. Wade and Cunningham share a last look. Cunningham clamps his jaws shut, fighting the agony. CREAK... CRACKLE... the ROOF COLLAPSES, BURYING BOTH OF THEM. And we... CUT TO BLACK. FADE UP ON: 42 INT. WORKSHOP - DAY 42 Morning's first sunlight. WADE's VOLTRON RING lies COMPLETELY MELTED in the DEBRIS. The camera follows it to Wade's hand... then up his arm to his FACE. WADE's eyelids flutter, and he COMES TO. He is naked, his hospital gown burned away. We see BLACKENED SLUDGE, SOOT, charred remains. The melted and scorched metal rod next to him. Wade slowly realizes where he is and what happened. He reaches down to his stomach wound... WHICH HAS MIRACULOUSLY HEALED. Wade sits up, stunned. DEADPOOL (V.O.) I didn't just get the cure to El Cáncer. I got the cure to everything. V43 EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING - PAST V43 VANESSA, tired, broken, mind seemingly elsewhere, walks towards her apartment. She passes a loving young COUPLE, arm- in-arm. Vanessa clocks this sadly, continues on. Behind her, PEOPLE walk to and fro. Among them, we REVEAL: WADE, dressed in ill-fitting pants and a hoodie. He is a TRAIN-WRECK, scarred face on display to the world for the first time. He looks purposeful, but tentative, walking behind Vanessa, GAINING on her. ANGLE ON: WADE's P.O.V. A BOY goes by on his bike, trying hard not to gape. A TODDLER in a STROLLER looks up and BURSTS INTO TEARS. The toddler's MOTHER hustles past. (CONTINUED) 71. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 V43 CONTINUED: V43 MOTHER Alex, don't stare. VANESSA stops and rifles through her purse for keys. STILL on Wade's P.O.V. Wade stops, too, suddenly paralyzed, as the moment to face Vanessa arrives. As he hesitates, torn with anguish, the WHISPERS seem to grow, rising in volume until they become deafening: WHISPER 2 (O.S.) Oh, my, god, that is so fucking gnarly. WHISPER 3 (O.S.) I just lost my appetite. Wade spins, trying to see where the voices are coming from. Nowhere... everywhere. The WHISPERS crescendo, now more in Wade's mind than in reality. He turns back to Vanessa, his face a mask of fear and pain... just as she disappears into her apartment building. The closing glass door reveals his own HIDEOUS REFLECTION STARING BACK AT HIM. DEADPOOL In the whole wide world, there's nothing as ugly... (beat) ...as fear. He gives up on his mission, backing away from his reflection, Vanessa, his old life. He stumbles off the curb and into the street, when... BAM! He is CRUSHED OUT OF FRAME by a SPEEDING BUS. SMASH CUT TO BLACK. FADE UP ON: A43 INT. MORGUE - NIGHT A43 THREE BODY BAGS lie on SLABS in a MORGUE. Without warning, the MIDDLE bag SITS UP STRAIGHT at the WAIST... ...then tries to CATERPILLAR its way to the edge of its slab... (CONTINUED) 72. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 A43 CONTINUED: A43 ...but instead pitches off the slab - CRUNCH - FACE-FIRST onto the floor. WADE (O.S.) Ow. B44 INT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - NIGHT B44 An FBI-STYLE `ORGANIZATIONAL CHART' has been pinned on Wade's CORKBOARD in the lair. A `pyramid' of baddies are linked by strings. Each baddie is depicted not by a photograph, but a child-like CRAYON DRAWING. Second from the top is the RECRUITER. At the APEX of the pyramid is AJAX HIMSELF. DEADPOOL, in his LAIR, sews together an early `proto- costume.' We see quick cuts of pieces of it going on: White Adidas track suit. White gloves. White boots. And some sort of white mask... A single gun, underarm holster, boot knife but no swords. VC44 INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT VC44 DEADPOOL Don't make me ask twice. Where's Francis?! DEADPOOL questions a bleeding thug, more bodies scattered across a floor littered with broken furniture behind him. Another thug rushes in and smashes a pool cue over Deadpool's skull. Deadpool snatches the broken shaft of wood and PUNCHES it into the thugs belly. A third thug staggers to his feet, pulls a pistol, fires multiple shots point blank. Deadpool staggers back, blood blossoming across his white suit. "CLICK" The thug stares in disbelief that Deadpool's still standing. Deadpool looks down at the shaft of wood in his hand. Thinks. (CONTINUED) 73. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 VC44 CONTINUED: VC44 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I said, where's... fucking... FR- (realizes) You made me ask twice. Deadpool spins the bloody cue with inhuman dexterity and starts towards the terrified thug, accidentally knocking over a PITCHER of BLOODY MARY onto his already bloody stained suit. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Fuck. Me. D44 INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY D44 DEADPOOL, TIDE STAIN-STICK in hand, tries unsuccessfully to get the blood out of his white suit. We get our first glimpse of BLIND AL, who's sitting next to Deadpool at the laundromat, completely unfazed by the bloodbath: BLIND AL Seltzer water and lemon for blood. (off Deadpool's impressed look, shrugs) Or wear red. Deadpool's eyes light up. He crumples this suit into a ball and tosses it into a trash bin. E44/H44 INT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - NIGHT E44/H44 Deadpool stabs a KNIFE into the picture of the GOON he just killed (at the bottom of the pyramid)... right in the FOREHEAD. F44 INT. LAIR - NIGHT F44 DEADPOOL's at the sewing machine again. Quick cuts of a RED `proto' outfit going on: Cheap red sweats. Red gloves. Red converse. As yet unseen RED MASK, which turns out to be... VG44 INT. UNDERGROUND FIGHT - NIGHT VG44 ...a RED `LUCHA LIBRE' PRO WRESTLING MASK. Deadpool stands in the shadows of a dingy basement, low ceilings, walls stacked high with cases of liquor. (CONTINUED) 74. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 VG44 CONTINUED: VG44 In a BOXING RING at the center of the room two WOMEN pound each other surrounded by a scrum of a CROWD. Deadpool spies his mark in a dirty white suit pressed in tight ringside. Deadpool pulls his mask down, wades into the crowd, throwing men aside, PLOWING toward his target. The mark sees Deadpool at the last second, turns as a KATANA flashes out and skewers his hand, pinning it to the wall. Deadpool fires a couple shots into the ceiling, sending the rest of the crowd rushing for the exit. DEADPOOL Don't make me ask twice. Where's- SMASH CUT TO: J44 INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - INTERROGATIONS/KILLS J44 Deadpool has a goon at sword-point. DEADPOOL Donde esta Francisco? THUG I don't speak Spanish. DEADPOOL (sighs) And I don't have time for you to learn. Deadpool kills the thug. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Take me to your leader. (turns) I've always wanted to say that. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Squeal. Like a pig. Where's Francis? DEADPOOL In no particular order. Where's your boss? And where can I find good Indian food? HENCHMAN Why the red suit? (CONTINUED) 75. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 J44 CONTINUED: J44 DEADPOOL That's so bad guys can't- never mind, they've already heard that. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) You're about to tell me everything you know about Francis Freeman. Known aliases. Current whereabouts. Boxers or briefs. Go. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (forces guy's mouth open, goes in with knife) Open your mouth. Here comes the airplane! GOON (gun pointed at forehead, a la Joseph Takagi) I don't know, I'm telling you. You're just going to have to kill me. DEADPOOL OK. (shoots goon in head, a la Hans Gruber, then, to audience:) Right?! DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (goon at knifepoint) Don't make me break out the Collective Soul CDs. DEADPOOL You give me your boss. I give you the rest of your life. (CONTINUED) 76. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 J44 CONTINUED: (2) J44 DEADPOOL (throws woman onto table) I don't feel good about myself. But where is he? I'm so sorry. L44 EXT./INT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS L44 New COSTUME. BOOM. A MAN dies. STAB. His picture is knifed. BOOM. STAB. QUESTIONS. BOOM! STAB! INTERROGATION. BOOM! STAB! DEADPOOL questions more and more thugs, each bit of information bringing him closer.... Soon there is a FOREST of knives sticking from the board. ...and only the RECRUITER and AJAX are left. K44/VK44 INT. RICE WORLD - NIGHT K44/VK44 A wretched room, dirty mattresses covering the floor. Dim light scatters through a tangle of IV bags hastily strung up over MEN too poor to have anywhere else to go and die. The RECRUITER kneels, speaking quietly to a particularly hardened patient. He places a card in the man's emaciated hand, then stands and walks toward a low doorway. The recruiter enters a brightly lit room stacked high with bags of rice. Two heavily armed THUGS fall in beside him. The men scan the aisles as they move toward a door leading out into an alley. DEADPOOL Agent Smith! They turn to see DEADPOOL, high atop a stack of rice bags. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I know, right?! I look like a million bucks. (turns to camera) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 77. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 K44/VK44 CONTINUED: K44/VK44 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Literally - this suit cost Fox a million dollars. Without a word, the Recruiter flees, running through the big roll-up door. Deadpool leaps to land between the two bodyguards as they draw their weapons and spray the room with gunfire. One goes down in a bloody heap. Deadpool leaps toward the other, skewers him with both swords. The thug falls backward, dead before he hits the ground. L44/VL44 EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT L44/VL44 DEADPOOL Come out, come out, wherever you are! (darkens) Don't make me ask tw- (pleasantly surprised) Good for you! The Recruiter has stepped timidly from between overflowing garbage bins, hands raised, eager to talk his way out of this mess: RECRUITER To whom should I address my... desperate bargaining? DEADPOOL Don't recognize the voice? Maybe the resumé: Forty-one confirmed kills. Make that Eighty-nine. Seven the past week alone. Same rate most folks... (pulls out SWORD) ...get a shave. RECRUITER (realizes who it is, fights to stay composed) Mr... Wilson? DEADPOOL Ding-ding-ding! Now... you're about to tell me where I can find your boss. Or I'm gonna make you feel worse. Wait... Deadpool brings the sword closer to the recruiter's face. Turns to CAMERA: DEADPOOL (CONT'D) ...worse than worse. (CONTINUED) 78. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 L44/VL44 CONTINUED: L44/VL44 RECRUITER And I pride myself on being persuasive. SMASH CUT TO: RS44 INT. SISTER MARGARET'S - DAY - PAST RS44 WADE stands in the shadows. WEASEL sits at a table. WADE No... no way! I'm not making her life as ugly as mine! WEASEL C'mon, you can't look that bad! It's like that blemish no one notices but you. WADE Wrong. I'm a monster, inside and out. I belong in a circus, the kind that rolls around Eastern Europe in covered wagons. WEASEL I can't envision a scenario where Vanessa won't take you ba- (Wade steps into light, takes off his hoodie) -aaaaaccckkk!! Holy shit. You... are... terrifying. You look like an avocado had sex with an older avocado. Wade grabs the bottle of JACK DANIELS from the table, GUZZLES. WEASEL (CONT'D) We might have to move our relationship to text and phone only. Wade ignores Weas, slams down the bottle: WADE And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug, the asshole who ran that mutant factory, escaped to who knows where. WEASEL I take back the Vanessa thing. You have only one option. WADE Find Francis-Go-Fuck-Himself. (CONTINUED) 79. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 RS44 CONTINUED: RS44 WEASEL (not listening) Star in low budget horror movies. Seriously, you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah. WADE (equally not listening) I'm gonna work my way through his crew... crushing bad guys' skulls, `til one of `em leads me to Francis. Then I'll force him to cure this face. Stomp his bloody guts into a fine vintage. And win Vanessa back. WEASEL OK. Not exactly the plot of Beauty and the Beast, but cool. Good news, that douche thinks you're dead. Advantage you. He won't think you're coming. Bad news, with a puss like that, you'll be spotted fast. WADE (derisive) So what do you suggest? A mask? WEASEL Not a bad idea! You... are... haunting. Your face is the stuff of nightmares. WADE (nods) Like a testicle with teeth. WEASEL How `bout a super-suit? And a nickname! Bitter-Boy. Super-Fist. Captain Never- Die. (deflates at a thought) WADE What? WEASEL Nothing. It's just... you know, I just realized, I'm never winning the- Weasel looks over to Wade, sees him staring. He follows Wade's gaze up to the board on the wall. WADE Deadpool. (CONTINUED) 80. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 RS44 CONTINUED: (2) RS44 As Wade says the word, he and Weasel share a look. EUREKA. Wade holds up the BOTTLE. WEASEL Deadpool. To you, Mr. Pool. The two CLINK GLASSES. 44A INT./EXT. MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT - PAST 44A A highly pleased DEADPOOL holds up the-soon-to-become-famous MASK for the first time, ushering in... a MONTAGE: WADE, at SISTER MARGARET's, receives a YELLOW CARD with a Cypress Tree from WEASEL. He turns a LUCHA LIBRE mask INSIDE OUT to reveal the classic DEADPOOL MASK we all know and love. Puts it on. Then dresses - piece-by-piece - in the RED UNIFORM we've come to know and love. And at last, UNSHEATHES A KATANA. The sword TWIRLS, SLASHES, LUNGES into shadow. A HANDKERCHIEF WIPES BLOOD from the BLADE. The katana gets SHEATHED again. The same yellow card is now RECEIVED and PUNCHED by Weasel. Wade is paid in TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS. WHIP CREAM froths onto a shot glass. A BLOW-JOB is TOSSED BACK. Meanwhile, VANESSA plays SKEE-BALL wistfully by herself at the ARCADE: SKEE-BALLS roll into HOLES. LIGHTS FLASH. TICKETS CHURN OUT. VANESSA catches a reflection of someone STARING at her from across the lobby. When she spins around, the culprit is GONE. Vanessa SHIVERS... but it's a warm shiver, somehow. A HEAP of TICKETS slides across the prize counter. A big STUFFED ANIMAL slides into Vanessa's arms. Vanessa tosses it into an empty CLOSET inside her and Wade's former APARTMENT. Then stares out the SPIDER-WEB CRACK in the window. Back at DEADPOOL's LAIR, Deadpool places various suspicious accoutrements on the NORNAS COFFEE TABLE: an 8x11 framed photo of VANESSA. A BOTTLE of JERGENS. A BOX of KLEENEX. His BELT. His powder-blue CROCS. Deadpool kicks back on the FUTON. Smiles under his mask. CUT TO: BLIND AL, building yet another shelving unit, looking up with a grossed-out frown: `Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing?' Next, DEADPOOL finishes plastering hundreds of ADVENT CALENDARS he's purchased onto one WALL of his LAIR. (CONTINUED) 81. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 44A CONTINUED: 44A When the wall is covered, he carefully pins the FIRST ornament onto the FIRST tree on the FIRST calendar. And at last, his MASK comes OFF and his HEAD hits the PILLOW. Instantly, the montage CRANKS UP its SPEED, with quicker and quicker EDITS. The visual totems that have just been introduced begin to FLY by... shorthand for the passage of time: Yellow cards are given, received, punched. Blades are unsheathed, sheathed, cleaned. Whip cream sprayed. Drinks consumed. Skee-balls rolled into holes. Tickets won. Prizes earned. Tossed onto a EVER-GROWING PILE in the closet. VANESSA staring out her window. Jergens pumped. Kleenexes pulled. Crocs discarded. BLIND AL's ears plugged. Ornaments are pinned to calendars. Lords a-leap. Swans a- swim. Maids a-milk. Mask comes off. Head hits pillow. Mask pulls on. The images fly by FASTER... FASTER... FASTER. Whip cream. Skee-balls. Crocs. Ornaments. Weasel. Deadpool. Vanessa. Al. `I NEED A HERO' plays faster and faster, too - higher and higher, like a record on too many RPMs. The effect is rhythmic... hypnotic... ...until finally, the montage REACHES a CRESCENDO. And then BOOM! Ratchets back to REGULAR SPEED: `CHRISTMAS MORNING' has arrived. All the calendars but one are now fully studded with decorations. DEADPOOL plucks out one last STAR to pin atop the final TREE. Only it's not a star at all, it's AJAX's MUG SHOT clipped out from the old NEWSPAPER. With great satisfaction, Deadpool pins the faded photo to the last treetop. The music dies, and Deadpool turns to camera. (CONTINUED) 82.

DEADPOOL has ONE LEG in his COSTUME and the other LEG still stabbing for the other pants-hole. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Late-late-late-late-late! He HOPS ACROSS the hall past BLIND AL, not really paying attention to her. We're revisiting the moment from earlier JUST AFTER she TRIPS on Deadpool's DUFFEL of AMMUNITION, PICKS it up, and DRAGS it OFF. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Hurry-hurry-hurry-hurry-hurry! BLIND AL I hope you're doing us the courtesy of pants. 47 EXT. CITY STREET - DAY - PAST 47 DEADPOOL runs out to the street corner and WAVES. DEADPOOL Taxi! A TAXI - if you've been paying attention, you will recognize it - pulls up to the curb. Deadpool opens the rear door. A WOMAN steps out, pausing to pay Dopinder. WOMAN Keep the change. Deadpool frowns. The woman is pulling her money from a BERNADETTE PETERS CHANGE PURSE. Deadpool's eyes raise from the purse to the woman holding it: BERNADETTE PETERS HERSELF! Deadpool doubletakes, then shakes his head (`Nah, couldn't be...') and climbs into the cab. Who is behind the wheel but... DOPINDER Where do you want to be going! (CONTINUED) 83. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 47 CONTINUED: 47 DEADPOOL (looks to camera) And we all know how this turned out. Cue Benny Hill speed... The action goes into Benny-Hill-like HYPER-SPEED as we relive the opening scenes of the movie: DEADPOOL's CAB RIDE. AJAX crumpling up his orange jumpsuit and switching places with a motorcycle RIDER at the RAFT. The FREEWAY FIGHT with AJAX's GOONS. The CONFRONTATION with COLOSSUS. Until at last... VRS48 EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY VRS48 Transport TRUCKS idle in the loading dock. A docile SUPER-SLAVE, fitted with a control collar and cuffs, steps into a CRATE IDENTICAL to the ONES AJAX DELIVERED TO THE WARLORD in ACT ONE. He lies down. ANGEL DUST is overseeing. She plunges a pistol-grip syringe into his neck and fires: ANGEL DUST For your flight. The man's eyelids flutter shut. Next to him, four identical crates hold four unconscious men and women. The workshop henchmen hammer on the tops and laboriously load them up into the truck. ANGEL picks up one over her shoulder with ease. She turns at the sound of a sputtering motorcycle getting closer. Ajax rolls in on one of the battered black bikes from the freeway. Smoke curls from its broken tailpipe. He steps off the bike while it's still moving, just letting it roll forward and tip to the ground with a clank. AJAX (O.S.) Quit showing off, Angel. Angel doesn't seem surprised by his dirty and bloodied appearance. A raised eyebrow and a disapproving look is all she has for her boss. RSA48 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY RSA48 A WAREHOUSE full of SURGICAL EQUIPMENT. OVERHEAD LAMPS. FABRIC TENTS. CHROME TABLES, one of which Ajax sits on. AJAX Wade Fucking Wilson. (CONTINUED) 84. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 RSA48 CONTINUED: RSA48 ANGEL DUST stands in front of him, putting stitches into his GORY MESS of a SHOULDER WOUND. He doesn't so much as FLINCH. ANGEL DUST Makes perfect sense. AJAX I suppose if I looked like him, I'd wear a mask too. (Angel finishes final stitch) Only wish I mended the same. Ajax pops off the table. Swings his arm around, testing his shoulder. AJAX (CONT'D) Not to worry. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms. ANGEL DUST And if he heals? AJAX He can't - if there's nothing left of him to heal. And then we go back to business as usual. Ajax's hand is a blur as he plucks the MATCHSTICK from Angel's mouth. AJAX (CONT'D) What say we leave the matches at home? 49 INT. DEADPOOL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT 49 ...the PAST reaches the PRESENT. REGULAR SPEED AGAIN. DEADPOOL is sitting on his futon, Crocs on, staring at camera. DEADPOOL There. All caught up. (shifts weight, moans, lies back on futon) BLIND AL (O.S.) Tylenol P.M.? BLIND AL shuffles over from the kitchen with a cup of tea and a bottle of Tylenol. She eases down onto the futon next to Deadpool. (CONTINUED) 85. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 49 CONTINUED: 49 DEADPOOL You can stick that where you stuck the Bactine! I found my stash of wisdom- tooth Percocet in the Storjorm, and I'm orbiting Saturn. But I appreciate the gesture. Deadpool lays his head on Blind Al's shoulder and gently rubs her face with his KID HAND. BLIND AL Am I crazy, or is your hand really small? DEADPOOL The size of a KFC spork. BLIND AL Eesh. I get why you're so pissy. But your mood's never gonna brighten `til you find this woman you love and tell her how you feel! DEADPOOL What do I keep saying, Mrs. Magoo? She wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand. BLIND AL Love is blind, Wade. DEADPOOL No, you're blind. The ROOMBA sucks up THREE SCREWS next to an IVAR shelving unit. BLIND AL What was that? DEADPOOL A clue why our Ivar shelving unit's about to fall the fuck apart. BLIND AL So you're just gonna lie there and whimper? DEADPOOL Just clocking time `til this arm plows through puberty. I've got a new Christmas Day. (CONTINUED) 86. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 49 CONTINUED: (2) 49 Deadpool throws his feet, CROCS and all, up on the coffee table. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Now, ya may want to leave the room.

NO. 5 ORANGE - NIGHT VB51 DEADPOOL and WEASEL walk hastily, purposefully into the eye of the storm. Deadpool is a HOT MESS. DEADPOOL I'm about to lose what's left of my shit. Is there a word for half-afraid, half- furious? WEASEL Afurious? Wait, is it Monday?! They have an amazing Matzah Ball Soup Monday. (beat) Never mind. Have you figured what you're gonna tell her? DEADPOOL (thinks) Fuck. WEASEL It's a start. 51A INT. `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 51A Lights flash. Music pumps. From across the room we see WADE and WEASEL enter. Weasel jokes with the DOORMAN while Wade scans the crowd, searching for Vanessa. EMCEE STAN LEE, sweatsuit, gold chains, Beats headphones, lords from a glass cubicle: STAN LEE Coming onto the stage, give it up for... Chastity! 87. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 52 INT. `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 52 WEASEL Or as I like to call her, Irony! DEADPOOL navigates through a TIGHTLY-PACKED CROWD toward the MAIN STAGE, accompanied by WEASEL. DEADPOOL We gotta find her fast. Before fuck-ass. WEASEL How do you even know she's here? DEADPOOL I come for the French Onion Soup. How do you think? I'm constantly stalking that fox. Deadpool STOPS in his tracks, STARING. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Every time I see her is like the first time. REVERSE ANGLE to reveal what Deadpool is looking at: the gorgeous backside of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS in a skimpy dress. Back to Deadpool: DEADPOOL (V.O.) Even from this angle. Especially from this angle. Hypnotized, Deadpool puts one foot in front of the other, approaching the waitress. Suddenly, the WAITRESS TURNS to reveal her face: VANESSA. Deadpool immediately CHICKENS OUT, puts his head down, turns away from her into the press of MEN around one of the stages. Vanessa catches the vaguest glimpse, but before she can get a better look, Deadpool is swallowed up by the crowd. She gets that warm shiver again... the one that says she's feeling an old presence. She stares after Deadpool. It couldn't possibly be. Deadpool pushes past the men, almost in a panic, beating a HASTY RETREAT toward WEASEL at the back of the room. (CONTINUED) 88. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 52 CONTINUED: 52 DEADPOOL (V.O.) Shittiest moment numero tres. Deadpool walks past Weasel, fleeing into the men's room... 53 INT. MEN'S REST ROOM - CONTINUOUS 53 ...and SPLASH! Washes his face at the SINK. DEADPOOL Lezzdothis. Before I re-reconsider. Maximum effort. A hand comes into frame offering a paper towel. It belongs to a WASHROOM ATTENDANT in a tuxedo vest. Deadpool uses the towel to wipe his face and finishes with the attendant's sleeve. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Sorry. (tries to dry attendant's sleeve with paper towel) I get very uncomfortable around you guys. (takes mint off counter, then condom off counter, then sees tip jar) Crisp high five? 54 INT. `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 54 VANESSA sets down a tray of empty glasses.

Said somethin' about an old boyfriend? 55 EXT. `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT 55 VANESSA exits the club into an ALLEY, one of Wade's old jackets thrown over her shoulders. One sickly street lamp casts some light. The rest is obscured in SHADOW. Vanessa spies the shape of a MAN hiding in the shadows. VANESSA I knew it was you. Vanessa is seized by memories. She peers into the dark, heart pounding. VANESSA (CONT'D) With the weird, curvy edges. (CONTINUED) 89. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 55 CONTINUED: 55 Then steps forward slowly, nervously. Overcome with emotion. VANESSA (CONT'D) (barely audible) Like a jigsaw puzzle. No one answers. Vanessa gets a bad feeling and starts to back up. The man steps confidently into the light. Not WADE... ...but AJAX. Vanessa spins around and runs straight into Angel Dust, who step out of the shadows. Vanessa make a grab for her purse, contents spilling out onto the grimy street, but her hand comes up with a TASER. She jams it into the flesh of Angel Dusts shoulder. Angel Dust just smiles as electricity arcs and sizzles. Then she grabs Vanessa's hand and twists it away. Vanessa THRASHES like a polecat. But Angel Dust is brutally strong. She clamps her hand around Vanessa's jaw and SQUEEZES, dangling her in the air by her FACE. AJAX You have Wade Wilson to thank for this. Vanessa's eyes widen in shock and surprise. AJAX (CONT'D) `The good Lord sends the fishing... Vanessa screams mutely into Angel Dust's palm. AJAX (CONT'D) ...but you must dig the bait.' 56 INT. `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - HALLWAY - NIGHT 56 WADE pushes through the crowd to find WEASEL sitting in GYNO ROW at the edge of the stage. He's in the middle of slipping a bill into a dancer's garter. WEASEL Manager said she went that way. (thumbs towards the back) Good luck, Tiger! DEADPOOL moves quickly down a HALL, turns a corner, and REACHES for the knob of the door to the alley. His eyes WIDEN as he remembers something IMPORTANT. (CONTINUED) 90. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 56 CONTINUED: 56 Deadpool reaches back and pulls up his hood to hide his scarred FACE.

DEADPOOL Mother-fucker best be wearing his brown pants. 58 INT. SCRAPYARD / ELEVATOR - PRE-DAWN 58 AJAX and Angel Dust stand at either side of a bound and gagged VANESSA. They are inside the metal cage of an INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR, going UP. DEADPOOL (V.O.) And... numero dos. A bare bulb casts harsh light as they rise past a dark mass of twisted metal. Ajax looks almost bored, hums to himself tunelessly. V59 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY V59 AJAX explains his plan to VANESSA: AJAX That's what I thought, but he keeps on coming back. Like a Bad Jesus. But despite all Wade's powers, I still hold the advantage: He feels. Too strongly for his own good. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block. VA60 EXT. X-MANSION - DAY VA60 A sign reads `PROFESSOR XAVIER'S SCHOOL FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS.' The sign is on the perfectly manicured front lawn of the gorgeous Gothic X-MANSION.

DEADPOOL Like there's something wrong with eating before sundown. Or saving money. But no. It's about me saving my girl from a bad guy, the one you two helped me lose. You do fight bad guys? (off NTW's stare) No time for hard stares, are you gonna fetch big-shiny-balls or not? Tell him I have an offer he can't refuse! NTW turns, disappears into the house. NTW Colossus! From off camera, we hear loudly, excitedly, from the second floor: COLOSSUS (O.S.) Is that you, Wade?! I knew you'd see error of ways! DEADPOOL Yep, that's me, seeing the error of my ways!

This is Deadpool's ARSENAL, big enough for a small army. In go the twin DESERT EAGLES. Then Weasel dumps an entire ARMFUL of AMMO BOXES into the duffel. WEASEL That's about... three thousand shells. A BEAT. Deadpool LOOKS AT CAMERA menacingly: DEADPOOL And we've all seen what I can do with twelve. BLIND AL enters, holding a STEYR AUG RIFLE. BLIND AL I was gonna spend tonight assembling the Borgsjo, but this is holding my interest. Both Deadpool and Weasel duck, afraid she might shoot them. DEADPOOL Careful, Ronnie Milsap, we're down-range! And we decided on the Orrberg, not the Borgsjo. BLIND AL Shit. WEASEL She cool? DEADPOOL The coolest. Plus, she could never pick you out of a line-up. BEEP-BEEP. DEADPOOL looks at his phone. The screen says, "Vanessa's Phone" DEADPOOL (CONT'D) It's Francis. He wants me to come to him. And he calls me a piece of- (squints, can't read) (CONTINUED) 93. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 60 CONTINUED: 60 WEASEL (points) That's the shit emoji. A turd with a smile, see? How did Google ever approve that? Blind Al grabs a Nerf N-Strike Elite Strong-arm Blaster from a drawer (it feels like a gun!) and goes to put it in the duffel. Deadpool almost stops her, then shrugs - maybe it will come in useful... BLIND AL That's every piece in the house. DEADPOOL Uh-uh-uh. Blind Al sighs - busted - she puts her leg up on a chair and pulls a tiny Saturday Night Special from an ankle holster... and is about to hand it over when instead, she turns, and... ...BOOM... shoots the ROOMBA, laying waste to it. BLIND AL It was him or me. (beat) I did hit it, right? DEADPOOL Please. It's been years since you've hit anything. See what I did there? BLIND AL Fuck you. Deadpool takes the tiny gun and shoves it in the small of his back. Then follows Weasel out the door. Then quickly turns back. DEADPOOL (to Al) In case I never see you again, I love you very much... and there's a hundred-ten million dollars buried somewhere in the apartment. Good luck. Watch your face. Deadpool slams the door behind him. 61 INT./EXT. TAXI - MORNING 61 A TAXI drives across the city, its BACK BUMPER scraping the ground, throwing off SPARKS. (CONTINUED) 94. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 61 CONTINUED: 61 In the PASSENGER seat: DEADPOOL, his DUFFEL at his feet. Behind the wheel: DOPINDER. DEADPOOL Any luck winning Gita back? DOPINDER I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool. But Bandhu is more craftier - and handsomer - than me. DEADPOOL (shrugs) It's all relative. Deadpool quickly LIFTS his MASK, revealing his SCARS to Dopinder. STARTLED, Dopinder FLINCHES and SIDESWIPES a PARKED CAR. COLOSSUS (O.S.) Stop the car. I must leave a note. Cut to the BACK SEAT to find COLOSSUS CRAMMED in, KNEES to CHEST. He's drinking a CAPPUCCINO in a Dunkin' Donuts cup. DEADPOOL Oh, please. I'll bet the halls of your high school were very well monitored. DOPINDER I cannot be stopping. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (O.S.) Wait, I'm getting a premonition. To Colossus's left is NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD. She's holding two fingers to her temple again, a la Professor X. Then nods toward Dopinder. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (CONT'D) He's uninsured. DOPINDER She indeed has ESPN! I am quite uninsuranced. DEADPOOL You mean ESP. But come on! I coulda- NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD -called that yourself? (CONTINUED) 95. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 61 CONTINUED: (2) 61 DEADPOOL Gaaaahhhh! Deadpool literally BOUNCES in frustration. DOPINDER Who brought this twinkly man? DEADPOOL Twinkly, but deadly. My big Russki friend doesn't like the idea of a whole new army of mutant mutton-heads. And I told him if he did me this solid, I'd consider joining his boy band. COLOSSUS It's not a boy band. DEADPOOL Sure it's not. The cab drives over a SMALL DIP and BOTTOMS OUT. CLANG. BANG. A muffled yelp comes from the TRUNK: VOICE (O.S.) Ow! Help. Me. BEAT. Dopinder reaches to turn up the RADIO. DEADPOOL Uh. Dopinder. What was that? DOPINDER Oh, that? That was Bandhu. COLOSSUS Bandwho? DOPINDER My romantic rival, Bandhu. He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, D.P. I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish. Then dump his lifeless corpse on Gita's doorstep like a cat with a dead bird. Mom and Dad will be over the moon. Deadpool looks back at Colossus and shrugs. DEADPOOL Something must've gotten lost in the translation. (gives surreptitious thumbs up to Dopinder) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 96. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 61 CONTINUED: (3) 61 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Seriously. This is no way to win Gita's heart. Return Bandhu home safe and gentle-like. And then woo Gita with your boyish charm... DOPINDER Fine, fine. Safe and gentle-like. Here we are... Dopinder pulls over and hits the meter. Then sighs. DOPINDER (CONT'D) I too am clairvoyance. I presume a crisp high five? DEADPOOL For you? Ten. DOPINDER Knock em dead, Pool Boy. Deadpool and Dopinder SLAP BOTH HANDS. DEADPOOL Time to make the chimichangas. 62 EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY 62 We hear the first bold notes of DMX's `X GON GIVE IT TO YA.' DEADPOOL, COLOSSUS, and NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD walk in SLO- MO across the scrapyard toward the COMBAT CARRIER. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Not often a dude ruins your face. Destroys your living. Grabs your future baby mama. Personally sees to 8 of your 10 shittiest life moments. And plans to lather-rinse-repeat on a buncha new chumps. Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas... This is as cool as Deadpool has ever looked. Muscles sprouting muscles. Katanas gleaming. Then, at the height of his coolness, Deadpool STOPS, sensing something amiss. DMX cuts out. REGULAR SPEED RESUMES as Deadpool looks down to spy his FLY DOWN. He ZIPS it UP, embarrassed. DEADPOOL (to camera) It happens. A'ight, cue up DMX again. (CONTINUED) 97. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 62 CONTINUED: 62 NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD Wait! Where's your duffel bag? DEADPOOL (freezes, it's missing) Gahhhhhhh! (pulls out a phone, dials) 63 INT. TAXI CAB - DAY 63 DOPINDER drives, head bobbing to a Bhangra Beat, HELLO KITTY DUFFEL still sitting in the passenger WHEEL WELL. On cue, Dopinder's CELL PHONE RINGS. Dopinder reaches for it, then fumbles it away. The phone falls to the floorboard. Dopinder looks ahead, sees the approaching traffic light is green, ducks down to make a grab, but when he returns his eyes to the road, the light is now red. Dopinder slams on his brakes. SCREECH! He manages to avoid the car in front. BAM! The taxi is REAR-ENDED, its TRUNK SMASHED like an accordion. We hear a HOLLER from inside. DOPINDER Bandhu? 64 EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY 64 DEADPOOL (hears crash) Goddamnit! Never mind. Nothing that can't be fixed by two swords and... (cracks neck) ...maximum effort. (points to imaginary D.J.) Gimme a beat! DMX KICKS IN AGAIN. Deadpool strides forward in SLO-MO. As they near the carrier a dozen armed and armored MERCS suddenly rise from behind the piles of scrap metal before them. Assault weapons raised, ready to fire. The trio stops, Colossus stepping in front of NTW, sheltering her behind his armored body. ANGEL DUST (O.S.) No one fires! Our heroes crane their necks to spy ANGEL DUST standing on the edge of the deck above. (CONTINUED) 98. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 64 CONTINUED: 64 ANGEL DUST (CONT'D) They're mine. Angel Dust LEAPS outward, falls like a stone, HITS the ground with a THUNDEROUS impact. The dust clears. She strides over the broken ground, smiling, READY for a scrap. DEADPOOL Long term, that's hard on your knees. (ALT:) Super-hero landing! Clearly you're far too much dude for me. Which is why... (points) ...I brought him. COLOSSUS steps forward into Angel Dust's path holding a pair of Adamantium HANDCUFFS just like he used on Deadpool. COLOSSUS I'd prefer not to hit a woman. So please place your hands behind your- BOOM! Without stopping Angel Dust throws a RIGHT HOOK from her HEELS. The punch CONNECTS with COLOSSUS's JAW. He goes flying, SCRAPING SPARKS ACROSS CONCRETE. DEADPOOL (sighs, points) I also brought her. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD steps forward on Deadpool's right. NTW chews her gum. Once. Twice. Then runs TOWARD Angel Dust, LOWERS her SHOULDER, and EXPLODES UP toward her with a WICKEDLY THUNDEROUS BANG of ENERGY and SOUND. Yes, Negasonic Teenage Warhead is exactly that - a living, breathing WARHEAD - like her own personal CANNONBALL. It's Angel Dust's turn to go flying backward, smashing into - and completely trashing - a heavy metal shipping container. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I feel sorry for the guy who tries to pressure her into prom sex. Angel Dust regains her feet, smiles dangerously at the Mercs. ANGEL DUST Never mind. Fire. (CONTINUED) 99. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 64 CONTINUED: (2) 64 Deadpool is already moving as the Mercs OPEN FIRE, full-auto. Deadpool grabs the still-woozy NTW and runs to the nearby cover of metal scrap, keeping between her and the gunfire. Colossus, now back on his feet, strides purposely forward. Bullets ping harmlessly off his metal skin. Angel Dust charges forward, snarling. DEADPOOL (shouts) Finish fucking her the fuck up. Colossus stops, annoyed. COLOSSUS Language. Please. Then Angel Dust SMASHES into him. The two collide with earth- shaking force. The sheer power of Angel Dust's momentum slams them backwards into-and through-a huge pile of scrap. 65 INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 65 AJAX pulls VANESSA forward to the edge of the carrier deck, forces her gaze downward toward the WAR ZONE below. AJAX How does it feel? Ex-boyfriend abandons you, becomes a sanity-challenged killer mutant in tights... VANESSA Says the sanity-challenged killer mutant in parachute pants. P.S. I've never played the role of damsel in distress. AJAX `Til now. Ajax yanks Vanessa away from the edge again. 66 EXT. SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS 66 Every MERC is pouring fire towards Deadpool's position. He hunkers down with NTW, her hands clamped tight over her ears. Deadpool unzips a zipper, reaches into his suit at the crotch, YANKS. Grimaces. We hear fabric tear. He pulls his hand out, waves a pair of torn TIGHTIE-WHITIES up from behind cover. (CONTINUED) 100. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 66 CONTINUED: 66 DEADPOOL Hey, fellas, whoa! Hold on! Don'tcha wanna hear my terms?! The mercs spot the white `flag.' Fire slackens from full- auto to a few pot-shots. Finally, Deadpool pops up. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) You guys only work for that shit-spackled Muppet fart! So I'm gonna give y'all the chance to lay down your firearms in return for preferential - bordering on gentle - possibly even lover-like treatment. The Mercs ignore him, opening fire AGAIN with a vengeance. Deadpool ducks and drops his tightie-whities. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Fine. Commando. (to NTW) Stay down, kid. Unless your power's stopping bullets. Deadpool SURGES forward, dives from cover, rolls. He comes up boot knife out, arm whipping forward- The nearest merc's head snaps back as the knife buries itself to the hilt in his eye socket. Deadpool sprints forward, zig-zagging, leaping, spinning as he closes the distance to the mercs. He's moving too fast for their guns to track. Bullets chew up the ground behind. Deadpool reaches the first pile of twisted metal, slides under, comes up behind two mercs taking shelter there. The first man turns, gun barrel swinging `round. Deadpool ducks, sweeps his legs, grabs his gun as he goes down. Deadpool rolls over him, firing BACKWARD into the man's face while spinning up to smash his boot into the face of the second merc. He slides past, firing a burst backward into the merc's neck as he falls. Seconds later he's leaping OVER the heads of the next pair of mercs. They turn to fire up at him - too slow. He fires short, controlled bursts down into their upturned faces. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Deadpool lands, tosses the empty smoking gun. Then slowly, lovingly, unsheathes his Katanas. (CONTINUED) 101. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 Deadpool is running forward now, weaving his way through the wreckage. Hunting. 67 EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY 67 COLOSSUS and ANGEL DUST engage in a BATTLE ROYALE. Colossus grabs Angel Dust by the SCRUFF of her NECK and HURLS her into an ABANDONED AIRCRAFT. CRUNCH. Angel Dust is on one knee, shaken, disheveled, one BREAST hanging out of her torn flak jacket. The prim Colossus covers his eyes. COLOSSUS Uh... you seem to have, um... Angel Dust smiles, tucks the wayward boob back in, then BLASTS Colossus with a FLYING KNEE that generates SHOCK WAVES so powerful, Colossus' CHROME actually RIPPLES. Colossus growls and CHARGES AGAIN. CUT TO: DEADPOOL spins around a corner as another pair of MERCS move forward, guns raised. Deadpool dives under their fire, guts them in blurred flash of steel. THRUST! SLICE! IMPALE! COMPLETE MAYHEM. Another trio of mercs rush around the corner, opening fire as they see their comrades fall. DEADPOOL runs toward them, flips and dodges like a whirling dervish, bringing GUARDS down in surgical, artistic fashion, as if where he's killing them means as much to him as how. Two men converge on Deadpool. He JUMPS. Mid-air, he flips his TWO KATANAS, GRIPS them upside-down like ICE PICKS, and STABS down in an arc to either side, SKEWERING two men through the TOPS of their HELMETS. A final merc comes around the corner and Deadpool spins, slices the strap of his gun, kicks the man in the chest, knocking him flat on his back and sitting on his face. DEADPOOL Tea-bag! (notices man under him) Bob?! BOB Wade?! (CONTINUED) 102. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 67 CONTINUED: 67 DEADPOOL It's been since... Jacksonville! BOB TGIFridays. DEADPOOL Liked the Loaded Potato Skins. Didn't like you. BOB Ditto. Deadpool rises and pulls Bob to his feet. Bob tries to draw a pistol but DP slaps it out of his hand, sends it skittering away. DEADPOOL Bob, y'mind taking a half-step right? No, your right. Never mind- Deadpool KNOCKS Bob OUT with the sword's GRIP, then NUDGES him sideways gently as he falls. At last, SILENCE. Deadpool steps forward. Then looks up toward the carrier above, waves. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Yoo-hoo! From above, AJAX peers down sees that Deadpool has killed his henchmen in such precise positions that their fallen bodies spell out: FRANCIS. Deadpool moves forward. LIMPING. CHARRED. TATTERED. But unbowed. AJAX That never gets old. But neither will you. Right on cue... ...three more Mercs appear to either side of Ajax, armed with HEAVY MACHINE GUNS - much NASTIER than any we've yet seen. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! The guards OPEN FIRE, and a BARRAGE of bullets rain down on the scrapyard, chewing up the landscape around Deadpool. (CONTINUED) 103. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 67 CONTINUED: (2) 67 Deadpool SPRINTS back toward cover, weaving, leaping, zig- zagging to avoid being hit. He dives behind some wreckage as more gunfire pings off the metal. DEADPOOL, pokes his head up, drawing a withering barrage of fire from the mercs above. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (O.S.) Hey! ANGLE ON: NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD, also taking cover, crouched under a broken PLANE WING. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (CONT'D) Climb on. Deadpool nods, then sprints toward her, springs high, flips, and lands on his back, spread eagled on the wing. DEADPOOL Light the candle... NTW nonchalantly SPITS out her GUM, crouches, and... EXPLODES UPWARD. The wing LAUNCHES up in a shallow PARABOLA, Deadpool CLINGING for dear life on TOP. 68 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - CONTINUOUS 68 Four MERCS continue firing down as the wing soars up. The WING SMASHES into them. All four go FLYING. Two end up DEAD under the wing. AJAX is thrown backward. One MERC lands, stunned, close to the edge. A LONG BEAT. AJAX rises to his feet. Then DEADPOOL pulls himself UP over the edge of the carrier and ROLLS onto the deck. He looks like he's been through a meat grinder - limping, scorched, bloody. Deadpool staggers to his feet. The last injured MERC lamely tries to GRAB his ANKLE. DEADPOOL Your plan to trip me to death? Has failed. Deadpool nonchalantly STABS him through the back of the neck like a butterfly on a display, then turns to face Ajax. (CONTINUED) 104. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 68 CONTINUED: 68 Twenty meters away, AJAX leans casually against... what else? THE PUNCH-BOWL. VANESSA is STRAPPED inside, lid open. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) You were right, babe. (wipes blood off sword) Red is my color. VANESSA Wade? AJAX (taps glass) What better way to climb back in your head... DEADPOOL You never left. VANESSA (to Deadpool) But you did, asshole. AJAX You two have a lot to work out. Take a deep breath. Wait. Wrong choice... Ajax quickly CLOSES the LID and hits a SWITCH. Vanessa starts taking short, desperate GASPS. AJAX (CONT'D) ...of words. DEADPOOL I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve. `Cause I'm'a go looking. Ajax squats down and picks up TWO STEEL-HAFTED FIRE-FIGHTING AXES, each with an ULTRA-SHARP BLADE on one side of its head and an EQUALLY SHARP CLAW on the other. Deadpool raises a KATANA and HURLS it NOT at Ajax, but the PUNCH-BOWL. The blade PENETRATES the PLEXI and tears into the RESTRAINT holding Vanessa's RIGHT WRIST, partly FRAYING it. AIR seeps through the CRACK. Vanessa catches a tiny BREATH. She TUGS on the frayed RESTRAINT. AJAX I hear you grow back parts. When I get done... parts will have to grow back you. DEADPOOL Good one. (CONTINUED) 105. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 68 CONTINUED: (2) 68 A big BOOMING sound from below and then the deck of the carrier shakes as if from a mild earthquake. Ajax and Deadpool look at each other. Shrug. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Let's dance. (beat) And by dance I mean try to kill each other. 69 EXT. SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS 69 BAM! Below, COLOSSUS delivers a HAYMAKER from hell itself. Angel Dust FALLS, then RISES, RIPS OFF the WING of a PLANE, and BLASTS Colossus with it... first like a BASEBALL BAT, then like a GOLF CLUB, then like a COUNTY FAIR MALLETS you use to try to ring a bell. CLANG! A battered NTW RACES toward Angel Dust. Angel Dust swings the wing, but NTW BASEBALL SLIDES UNDER it and EXPLODES up into her chin. Angel Dust is lifted off her feet into the side of the carrier, BUCKLING some of its supports. NTW rolls aside. 70 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - CONTINUOUS 70 And now, we get what we've been long been waiting for: THE FINAL CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE between DEADPOOL AND AJAX. AXES vs. KATANA, TEN STORIES UP... AJAX TAKES a MIGHTY, ROARING SWING with an AXE. DEADPOOL Yowww! STEEL SINGS as AXE and KATANA meet again and again. THRUSTS. PARRIES. SPARKS FLY! THUNK! Deadpool's BLADE passes through Ajax's THIGH and pins him to a piece of wreckage. CRACK! Ajax tags Deadpool's head with the FLAT of an axe. SNAP! Ajax BREAKS the sword's blade with an AXE, not feeling anything as he slides his leg off the sword. GASP! VANESSA grits her teeth, pulls against the restraints. The thick nylon begins to tear as she saws it against the katana blade. (CONTINUED) 106. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 70 CONTINUED: 70 CLANG! AJAX wields both axes in a red blur of painted steel. Deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted RAILING from the deck, barely blocks Ajax's windmilling swings. Finally, Ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from Deadpool's hands with one axe, while the sharp CLAW END of the other buries itself in Deadpool's FOREARM. Deadpool hollers. Deadpool's red suit has torn away, and the SKULL of his TATTOO bleeds from a HOLE in its FOREHEAD. Deadpool GRITS his TEETH and YANKS the AXE from Ajax's grasp. A spinning KICK sends the second axe flying after the first. Now they're completely unarmed. AJAX Fine. Fists. DEADPOOL Sounds like your last Saturday night. (smiles) The sense of humor survived. AJAX and DEADPOOL TRADE VICIOUS PUNCHES. It's HAGLER vs. HEARNS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Inspired, VANESSA strains against the torn nylon. RRRRIPPP! Her right wrist TEARS FREE. She uses her freed hand to start unlatching her other restraints. DEADPOOL throws short, blinding PUNCHES - rat-a-tat-tat - into AJAX's jaw. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Since you can't feel it? (holds up an INCISOR) I just knocked out your tooth. AJAX snarls, drives a SHOULDER into Deadpool, then MOUNTS him and BLUDGEONS his face with HAMMER-LIKE FISTS. DEADPOOL is starting to LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS when he turns his head to one side and spies the PUNCH-BOWL. We RACK FOCUS to VANESSA locking eyes with him from inside. Hers is an inspired... and INSPIRING look of LOVE. We hear a REPRISE of JOHN DENVER's `I WANT TO LIVE.' (CONTINUED) 107. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 70 CONTINUED: (2) 70 VANESSA pushes against the sealed door of the punchbowl with all her might. With a squeal of metal the latch breaks, the twisted metal flying off the lid as it slams open. Vanessa grabs the KATANA, jerks it free with another mighty effort. Then slides down the containers toward AJAX. With a fierce scream, she PLUNGES the blade into his KIDNEY. The blade punches through the other side but Ajax feels no pain, YANKS out the katana, and THROWS Vanessa aside violently. But it's all the opportunity Deadpool needs. He SURGES with energy and throws an THUNDEROUS UPPERCUT, BLASTING Ajax off. JOHN DENVER I want to liiiiiive! 71 EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY 71 Below: WHOOSH, BAM! Angel Dust ducks an exhausted Colossus's punch and KICKS him THROUGH another STEEL SUPPORT. Colossus COLLAPSES. The carrier GROANS. Angel Dust moves in for the KILL. Only out of nowhere... ...NTW strikes her in the chops and EXPLODES, sending the larger woman SMASHING into concrete with UNPRECEDENTED FORCE. Now it's Angel Dust's turn to be broken, smoking, seemingly down for the count. NTW approaches carefully to make certain it's all over... ...but Angel Dust shoots out an arm and GRABS her... DRAGS her in CLOSE... makes to SMASH her head like a walnut. ANGEL DUST C'mere, ya little bitch. NTW fights back valiantly, PUNCHING fast and hard with FLURRIES of ENERGY. Angel Dust is scorched and battered by the blows, but her adrenaline and rage SURGE. She grabs NTW around the neck, plants her into the ground... ...and begins to CHOKE the life out of her. NTW flails, cannot break Angel Dust's grip... ...but marshals her last remaining energy to live up to her name... ...and EXPLODE like an ALMIGHTY WARHEAD. BOOM! CUT WIDE to a GARGANTUAN EXPLOSION. (CONTINUED) 108. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 71 CONTINUED: 71 The ship SHAKES VIOLENTLY, then starts to LIST at a DANGEROUS ANGLE. 72 EXT. FLIGHT DECK / CONTINUOUS 72 DEADPOOL and AJAX are trading BLOWS again when the DECK SWAYS as if hit by a 9.0 EARTHQUAKE. Then with a thunderous, shuddering, groaning of metal the whole carrier begins to tilt. Loose wreckage begins to slide and tumble past. A shipping container barrels towards them and Deadpool kicks Ajax backwards, right into its path. SLAM! It plows into him and carries him with it as it disappears over the side. Deadpool scrambles and claws up the tilting floor and grabs hold of Vanessa. Deadpool looks around frantically... ...and then spies the PUNCH-BOWL, sliding toward them. Deadpool grabs the side as it slides past and throws VANESSA inside and SHUTS the LID for protection... They slam into the twisted metal railings at the bottom of the deck and hang there. Deadpool swings by one hand and stares at the scrapyard below. Huge chunks of metal slide and smash past to tumble to the ground a hundred feet below. Vanessa hangs onto Deadpool for dear life, her eyes locked on his... VANESSA If we survive this. I'm gonna kill you. DEADPOOL We have so much to catch up on. ...as the CARRIER topples in an AVALANCHE of STEEL! An EPIC collapse of SHRIEKING METAL. Flying glass. Nearly seismic booms. A mushroom CLOUD of thick, black destruction. FADE TO BLACK. 73 EXT. SCRAPYARD - RUBBLE PILE - DAY 73 Black. A crack of light appears, dust sifting down through the beam. (CONTINUED) 109. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 73 CONTINUED: 73 More light, more dust and debris pattering down onto-some kind of scratched glass in front of the lens. Finally a hole of bright sky fills the frame. CUT TO: COLOSSUS vigorously TOSSING aside MASSIVE SLABS of STEEL as he digs through the wreckage, uncovering the PUNCH-BOWL, damaged, but intact. The LID CREAKS OPEN - pushed by Vanessa's TREMBLING HAND. Vanessa climbs out dazed, dusty, coughing. COLOSSUS You're OK. Take it slow. Elsewhere in the rubble pile DEADPOOL's HEAD POPS UP from some DEBRIS, again, like the Caddyshack gopher. DEADPOOL I'm good. Deadpool is just staggering to his feet when AJAX emerges from under another BEAM and TACKLES him. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) ¡Caramba! (subtitled, in YELLOW:) For heaven's sake! The impact sends them both flying, rolling, over the edge of a metal container. They fall locked together, punching and grappling. They bounce/slide down the pile of rubble. Deadpool gets the better of the grappling and lands on AJAX's CHEST. He goes to TOWN with vicious FOREARMS and ELBOWS. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Wham! Wham! Wham! BAM! BAM! BAM. Bam. You can feel Deadpool's adrenalized catharsis. Ajax tries to block-CRACK! Deadpool shatters his elbow. Ajax other fist swings round, tags Deadpool, but he catches it, wraps it tight-SNAP! Ajax finally goes limp, both arms bent in horribly wrong directions. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (thrilled/exhausted) There are no words. (CONTINUED) 110. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 73 CONTINUED: (2) 73 Deadpool pulls out BLIND AL's SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL and AIMS it right BETWEEN AJAX's EYES. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Me and you are headed to fix this face. Or else... Deadpool places a piece of paper onto Ajax's chest. Ajax shakes off the cobwebs and examines the paper; it's Deadpool's CRAYON DRAWING of Ajax getting his brains blown out. Ajax actually LAUGHS. AJAX Sorry. It's just. All this time, you bought that I have the cure? I'm flattered. But do I really look like the scientist type? You want the guy behind the guy. His name's Dr. Killebrew. And he's long gone. Who knows where. DEADPOOL Um. What? AJAX You heard me. DEADPOOL You mean to say, after five long years, I've been chasing the wrong monkey? AJAX Sounds even stupider when you say it. DEADPOOL Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for? (chambers a round) Any last words? Good. I got one: (pulls back the hammer) Francis. COLOSSUS (O.S.) Wade! Deadpool turns to see Colossus, hands on hips, looking extra HEROIC. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD is STANDING at his SIDE. COLOSSUS (CONT'D) Four or five moments. (CONTINUED) 111. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 73 CONTINUED: (3) 73 DEADPOOL I'm sorry? COLOSSUS Four or five moments. That's all it takes... DEADPOOL To...? COLOSSUS Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full time job. Wake up a hero. Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true. Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice. To make a sacrifice. Conquer a flaw. Save a friend. Spare an enemy. Deadpool continues to hold the pistol to Ajax's head. COLOSSUS (CONT'D) In those moments, everything else falls away. The way the world sees us. The way we see oursel- BOOM! OFF-SCREEN, A GUNSHOT. COLOSSUS (CONT'D) (dry-heaves again) Huuugglh! Why! REVERSE ANGLE to Deadpool, who's just shot AJAX in the head with Blind Al's SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL. DEADPOOL You were droning on! (shrugs) I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least we've heard the last of him. If wearing super-hero tights means sparing psychopaths, maybe I wasn't meant to wear `em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you. COLOSSUS Just promise- DEADPOOL I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 112. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 73 CONTINUED: (4) 73 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (peers between Colossus and NTW) Now if you'll excuse me. I'm just a boy... about to stand in front of a girl... and tell her- what the fuck am I gonna tell her?! CUT TO: Deadpool's P.O.V. BETWEEN Colossus and NTW of VANESSA, who's now walking quickly TOWARD him. She brushes between the two X-men and without saying a word, GRABS the fallen PISTOL and PUMPS TWO EXTRA BULLETS into Ajax's corpse. VANESSA (bang) Gratuitous. (bang) Worth it. DEADPOOL (to camera) Anyone else turned on? (to Vanessa) That's what I love about y- Vanessa promptly PUNCHES Deadpool in the face. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I totally deserved that! (gets punched again) That too! (wards off knee) Maybe not the nethers. Vanessa restrains herself, then TURNS HER BACK, overcome. VANESSA Start talking. DEADPOOL I'm so sorry. For leaving. And taking so long to cowboy up. It's been a rough few years. VANESSA (snorts, dismissive) Rough? DEADPOOL I live in a crack house. With a family of twelve. At night, we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle. She's the fattest. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 113. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 73 CONTINUED: (5) 73 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) There's nothing we don't share. Floor space. Dental floss. Condoms. VANESSA So you live in a house! (turns to face him) DEADPOOL I woulda found you before now. But the guy behind this mask isn't the same guy you remember. VANESSA You mean this mask? Deadpool FLINCHES but doesn't STOP Vanessa from slowly, gently taking OFF his mask, revealing underneath... HUGH JACKMAN's `SEXIEST MAN ALIVE' People MAGAZINE COVER. Blood at the pierce points. Mouth/eyes cut out to make a `mask.' DEADPOOL And this one. In case the other fell off. VANESSA You mean like this? Vanessa starts PULLING OUT staples. DEADPOOL Oo. Ah. Quicker - like a Bandaid! Owww- di 5000. One last staple remains. Vanessa hesitates. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Sure? VANESSA Sure I'm sure. She PULLS it out. The photo FALLS, revealing DEADPOOL's SCARS. And two vulnerable, misty eyes. A beat. VANESSA (CONT'D) Ew. DEADPOOL (devastated) I understand. (CONTINUED) 114. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 73 CONTINUED: (6) 73 VANESSA (smiles) Kidding! Get over yourself! I'd hit that shit. DEADPOOL You already did. (rubs chin) Twice. Seriously? VANESSA (nods) After a brief adjustment period and one or two drinks. (smiles) It's a face... I'd be happy to sit on. Vanessa hooks Deadpool's PINKIE with HERS, PULLS him in to kiss him. DEADPOOL I'm also not the same under these pants. (whispers) Super-penis. Deadpool and Vanessa are ABOUT to kiss when... NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (O.S.) 1975 called. Deadpool realizes COLOSSUS and NTW are still standing WATCHING. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (CONT'D) It wants its peep show back. DEADPOOL Gah! What the hell are you two still doing here?! (to Colossus) You, go clean some chalk-board erasers, or be a... really Big Brother, or teach fat kids to eat lettuce. (to NTW) And you, Chicken Noodle. Well... (freezes) I feel something stupid coming on. (bounces) Gaaaaaaahhhhhh! (CONTINUED) 115. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 73 CONTINUED: (7) 73 NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD It's alright. (beat, tiniest of smiles) You're cool. DEADPOOL (STARES, elated) I am?! Omigod. That. Was. Not. Mean! Seriously, guys, it was a pleasure. For a second there, we felt like... like... (we expect `family') ...five mini lion robots forming a large super robot. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD There's the stupid. DEADPOOL Now, I meant it, both of you, fire up the Blackbird and shoo! Scram! Vamoose! Skedaddle! Don't make me keep thinking of these! They smile, shake their heads, and walk off. Deadpool turns back to Vanessa. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Where were we, darlin'? Oh, riiight. The best part. Deadpool KISSES Vanessa. The little kiss become a BIGGER ONE. Then... fading up from nowhere, with a slightly tinny quality... we hear WHAM!'s `CARELESS WHISPER.' Vanessa pulls back, puzzled. Deadpool raises his ANDROID. On the cracked and dirty screen, George's and Andrew's FACES beam from Wham!'s `MAKE IT BIG' album cover. DEADPOOL (CONT'D) `Wham!' As promised. The two share the longest kiss yet. DEADPOOL (V.O.) See, life can smell like Daffodil Daydream. So if you're sitting out there in your own personal Punch-Bowl. Ms. Mama June on your tongue. Find someone to hold... and someone to hold on to you. Life's next little train wreck... 116. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 74 INT. NEW WORKSHOP - DAY 74 DEADPOOL (V.O.) ..will be so much easier if you do. We find ourselves in a newer, spiffier version of the WORKSHOP, where a LAB TECHNICIAN is strapping down a new sickly VOLUNTEER/VICTIM. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Which brings us to shittiest moment number 1! The guy behind the guy, Dr. Killebrew, off scot-free. A SILHOUETTED FIGURE approaches the bed of the nervous volunteer, who smiles weakly. VOLUNTEER Can you make me better? REVERSE ANGLE to reveal whom he's talking to: the PUDGY, KINDLY-LOOKING DOCTOR WHO STROKED WADE'S HEAD IN THE WORKSHOP. He smiles, pats the volunteer's wrist. DR. KILLEBREW Better than better. DEADPOOL (V.O.) But let's look on the bright side. (sniffs) You smell what I smell? I mean besides stale popcorn and my post-fight man-funk? Dr. Killebrew holds up a syringe with a glint in his eye. DEADPOOL (V.O.) Sequel. Maybe even one of those ensemble team movies... 75 EXT. SCRAPYARD - RUBBLE PILE - DAY 75 DEADPOOL and Vanessa MAKE OUT LIKE CRAZY, LONG AND HARD. We slowly PULL BACK until they look SMALL against the toppled hulk of the COMBAT CARRIER. DEADPOOL (V.O.) So, `til next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy saying... I'm never gonna dance again... the way I danced with you. WHAM BELTS OUT `CARELESS WHISPER' as we ROLL CREDITS. 117. Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 V76 INT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY - POST CREDIT SEQUENCE V76 A hallway of a suburban home. DEADPOOL enters in a maroon and gray striped robe. DEADPOOL (short version) You're still here? It's over! Go home. Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool 2?! Sorry, we're low on dough. But if you can keep a secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in it. Cable! Someone suggested Mel Gibson for the role, buuuut- I was thinking Liam Neeson. Only problem, Liam likes to get paid. And more for Liam means less for me. Maybe we'll crowdfund the shit. Just you and me, kids. Shalom! DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (long version) You're still here? It's over! Go home. Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool 2?! Maybe a little Samuel L. Jackson? Sorry, that budget went to Weasel's Ketamine habit. But if you can keep a secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in it. Cable! You're allowed to show your pleasure. I'd love Liam Neeson for the role, but Liam likes to get paid. And more for Liam means less for me. So we'd best crowdfund the shit.

A P O C A L Y P S E N O W Original screenplay by John Milius. Inspired by Joseph Conrad's "HEART OF DARKNESS". This draft by Francis Ford Coppola. December 3, 1975. 1 PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago. Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface; then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, in a psychedelic hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier beneath has exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely. Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance. We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears. As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted in a paisley design. Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes. ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW. Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching. The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out with AUTOMATIC FIRE. Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn, screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed. Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved; they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else. They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns. They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US as they move. The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE. We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him, only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is frightened. An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the dead. OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame, bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud, electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK : MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW 2 TITLE SEQUENCE The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying; transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely look at, like the sun itself. Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more distant. The TITLES CONTINUE. We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the MUSIC now. We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds, as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE. We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds, close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere; CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California; Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like shapes of : 3 EXT. MARINA DEL REY The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day. It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the head of a large American Corporation, and this is his party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war paint. Charlie is going on and on : CHARLIE ... It's crazy -- sugar is up to 200 dollars a ton -- sugar ! LAWYER What about oil ? CHARLIE Food, oil --look, let me show you something. This is the economy of the United States in two years -- He takes a newspaper, draws a circle. CHARLIE (continuing) This is West Germany. (he draws another, bigger circle) This is Japan. (another , bigger) This is Italy. (a dot) This is Iran. (a very big circle) And this is Saudi Arabia... In two years ? (a gigantic circle) Do you understand ? ACCOUNTANT What's to prevent it ? CHARLIE Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you, I didn't build a two-billion-dollar company in the last twenty years by doing nothing. We can protect our interests. (pause, for a drink) We are still the most powerful nation in the world. Militarily. He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper. CHARLIE (continuing) You know bodyguard; he was a captain in Viet Nam. You talk to him, except he won't talk. This kind of man can kill you with his pinky. A nice quiet fella, though. The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group. CHARLIE (continuing) Carries a attache case at all times. You know what's in it ? (another sip) An Ingram Machine pistol. Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it : CHARLIE	WILLARD (V.O.) I don't tahe chances, and	Bullshit. You can kill neither should this country.	with the ridge of your If we're strong, we should hand to the throat; you protect our interests, and	can crush a skull with we should have the respect	your knee... but you of the world, even if it	can't kill anybody with takes another war.	your pinky. The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party : Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES. WILLARD (V.O.) The attache case has been empty for three years, but it makes him safe to think there's a machine pistol in it. I don't like automatic weapons. They jam. I saw a friend of mine get ripped open because he flicked his M-16 to automatic, and it jammed. How much money did the contractors make on the M-16 ? Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some reading, flirting, drinking. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) He likes to hear stories about Nam. I tell him I can't; they're not cleared. The truth is he wouldn't understand. We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We MOVE CLOSER. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) There's no way I can tell them... what really happened over there. I wouldn't've believed it if someone'd told me. We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips from a beer, but we cannot see his face. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) There was only one part that mattered -- for me, anyway. I don't even know if I remember all of it. I can't remember how it ended, exactly -- because when it ended I was insane. DISSOLVE TO : 4 EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes. Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L. WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his shoes and sell him things. WILLARD (V.O.) But I know how it started for me -- I was on R. and R. in Saigon; my first time south of the DMZ in three months. I wasn't sure, but I thought this guy was following me. Willard looks back. 5 HIS VIEW an American CIVILIAN. 6 MED. VIEW Willard ducks into a bar. 7 INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by. An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of drinks and approaches Willard's table. CAPTAIN How about a drink ? WILLARD Sure, thanks. He sits down at the table with the drinks. CAPTAIN Winning the war by yourself. WILLARD (he calls for the waiter) Part. CAPTAIN Which part is that ? WILLARD My part. (TO THE WAITER) Beer, with ice and water. CAPTAIN That's good gin. WILLARD I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis. CAPTAIN Delta ? WILLARD No. CAPTAIN North ? WILLARD Yeah. Way north. CAPTAIN What unit were you with ? WILLARD None. CAPTAIN Rangers, eh? WILLARD Sort of. The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over his shoulder. CAPTAIN Were you Longe Range Recon -- WILLARD No -- I worked too far north for LRRP. He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar, then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway. CAPTAIN That's quite an array of ribbons... WILLARD Let's talk about you. CAPTAIN I was an FO for the 25th. WILLARD Tracks ? CAPTAIN Yeah. WILLARD Fat. That's real fat. CAPTAIN Sometimes. WILLARD At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ? CAPTAIN Thirty -- sometimes fifty. WILLARD You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them. (solemnly) I swear to God I would have, too, if ... CAPTAIN I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam. WILLARD We do. CAPTAIN How long were you up there ? WILLARD A long time. CAPTAIN A year ? Waiter another beer. WILLARD I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me. Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain. He rises and comes over to the bar. WILLARD (continuing) What do you want ? CIVILIAN (indicating the Army jeep) If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us. WILLARD Whose orders ? CAPTAIN Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang. WILLARD Who are you ? CIVILIAN The agency. Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks roght out toward the jeep without saying another word. The Civilian follows. 8 EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily fortified, concealed compound. WILLARD (V.O.) They took me to some place outside Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters for all operations in South East Asia. I'd worked for Intelligence before -- Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground corridor -- they enter. 9 FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic maps and filled with smoke. The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly reclaiming it. WILLARD Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir. COLONEL (O.S.) Okay, Willard, sit down. Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN. COLONEL Have you ever seen this officer before, Captain Willard ? He points to the Major. WILLARD No, sir. COLONEL This gentleman or myself ? WILLARD No, sir. COLONEL I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ? WILLARD I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir. MAJOR Very good. He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map. COLONEL You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ? WILLARD I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir. The officer smiles at this. COLONEL Then you can appreciate Command's concern over their -- shall we say 'erratic' methods of operation. (pause) I have never favored elite units, Captain, including your paratroopers or whatever. Just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesn't give him any priviliges in my book -- not in this man's army. MAJOR We didn't need 'em in Korea -- no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy and an M-1 Garand, none of this fancy crap -- no sir. CIVILIAN (stopping him) Major. COLONEL We have Special Forces A detachments all along the Cambodian border. Two here and another one here -- twelve or fourteen Americans -- pretty much on their own; they train and motivate Montagnard natives; pick their own operations. If they need something, they call for it, and get it within reason. What we're concerned with is here. 10 CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP COLONEL The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba. It was originally a larger base, built up along the river in an old Cambodian fortress. The area has been relatively quiet for the past two years -- but -- 11 MED VIEW COLONEL ... Captain, we know something's going on up there -- Major -- The Major looks at some papers in front of him. MAJOR Communications naturally dwindled with the lack of V.C. activity, this is routine, expected ... but six months ago communication virtually stopped. COLONEL About the same time -- large numbers of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent began leaving the area -- this in itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the Rhade Tribe that lived in the area for centuries. But what is unusual is that we began to find Rhade refugees too -- in the same sampans as the M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid of V.C. They've put up with war for twenty years -- but something is driving them out. MAJOR We communicate with the base infrequently. What they call for are air strikes, immediate -- always at night. And we don't know what or who the air strikes are called on. WILLARD Who ? MAJOR You see, no one has really gone into this area and come back alive. WILLARD Why me ? MAJOR Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel, Special Forces. We understand you knew him. He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand. WILLARD Yeah. COLONEL He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba. The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder, flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military. Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like someone dumb, except very fast. VOICE (ON TAPE) Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick -- Mark flare -- affirmative damn -- Immediate receive -- hearing automatic weapons fire man ... GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background. SECOND VOICE Blue Delta five This Big Rhine -- three Need that ordinance immediately Goddamn give it to me immediate Christ -- Big Rhino -- Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn. A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER -- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words. THIRD VOICE This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta. MAJOR That's Colonel Kurtz. KURTZ (V.O.) I want that napalm dropped in the trees -- spread it among the branches. We'll give you a flare -- an orange one -- bright orange. (STATIC) We'd also like some white phosporous, Blue Delta. White phosporous, give it to me. STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off. WILLARD I only met Kurtz once. CIVILIAN Would he remember you ? WILLARD Maybe. COLONEL What was your impression of him ? Willard shrugs. CIVILIAN You didn't like him. WILLARD Anyone got a cigarette. The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks. WILLARD (continuing) I thought he was a lame. COLONEL A lame ? WILLARD This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument. COLONEL About what ? WILLARD I don't know. He was a lame, that's all. COLONEL But why ? WILLARD He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill. COLONEL Well, he's killing now. WILLARD Maybe. CIVILIAN What does that mean ? WILLARD Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it. COLONEL It's got to be Kurtz. CIVILIAN The point is that Kurtz or somebody attacked a South Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three days ago. Last week a Recon helicopter was lost in the area -- another took heavy damage -- direct fire from their base camp. WILLARD Our Recon flight ? CIVILIAN Ours. WILLARD Touchy. CIVILIAN You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out. WILLARD You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet. CIVILIAN Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command. WILLARD Terminate ? CIVILIAN Terminate with extreme prejudice. 12 FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms. A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area. This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle- dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet, M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard. 13 MED. VIEW We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE. WILLARD (V.O.) I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean. WILLARD Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise. CHIEF All right with me, I used to drive a taxi. WILLARD Let's go. The Chief nods. They all break formation and jump aboard and otherwise go about their work. The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads to the ocean. DISSOLVE TO : 14 FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another. 15 MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale. Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just stares ahead into space, swallowing. DISSOLVE TO : 16 LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds -- the sea is calm again. DISSOLVE TO : 17 VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him. CHIEF The Delta closes off to us about ten miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out. WILLARD We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ? CHIEF 'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down. WILLARD Shot himself. What for ? CHIEF Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ? Pause, looking at Willard. 18 CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all stand silently -- suddenly it stops. WILLARD Arch light. CHEF I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens. CHIEF Anybody see some smoke ? CLEAN Too far inland. LANCE There they are. He points up to the sky. 19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor trails streaming white against the dark blue sky. CLEAN Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not till it's too late -- don't have to hit you neither, concussion'll do it for a quarter mile or better. Burst your ears -- suck the air outta your lungs. 20 FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned. He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He flips through the letters and other documents. WILLARD (V.O.) The dossier on A detachment had letters from Kurtz' wife and the wives and families of his men. All asking where to send future mail, understanding the necessery silence due to the nature of their work -- None of the men had written home in half a year. Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting of the distant B-52 BOMBING. 21 CLOSE - ON WILLARD studying, examining a report. 22 MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his career as represented in the pictures in the dossier, as Willard reads : WILLARD (V.O.) Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a dedicated and well-disciplined spirit. He is a fine officer, combining military efficiency -- with a broad background in the Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ... Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the 161st Petroleum Supply Group sign. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... He views his military career as the dedication of his talents to bringing our values and way of life to those darker, less fortunate areas in the world. A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... I feel Captain Kurtz' request for Special Forces training is highly unusual in regard to his past humanitarian concerns, and his somewhat liberal politics, though I can see no reason to deny it. A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam jungle. His face is blank and vacant. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... We feel Major Kurtz' need to bring a sense of Western culture to the backward peoples of these areas will be of use in accordance with our 'Vietnamization' programs ... MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS. DISSOLVE TO : 23 EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA WILLARD (V.O.) One day later we came to an advanced staging area along the coast. This was our last chance to pick up supplies before approaching the mouth of the Nung River. The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load- ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera- tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist." Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers -- helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds advanced staging areas like the Americans. As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices something. LANCE Hey. They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water- skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at one another. 24 VIEW ON THE DOCK The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings. CHIEF Lance -- I want you to go with the Captain an' get three extra drums of fuel and maybe scrounge some more 50 caliber. LANCE Yeah -- look at those uniforms. 25 FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the airplane. CHIEF Poor bastards, have a long year to go. The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of Advanced Infantry Training to back them up. 26 FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill- ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard. SERGEANT I don't know anything about these papers, sir. WILLARD They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said. SERGEANT Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ? WILLARD Right now -- I am. SERGEANT Well who the hell verifies that ? WILLARD I do. He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused. CHIEF No shit -- what's all the activity for around here ? SERGEANT The show -- WILLARD What show ? SERGEANT Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff -- WILLARD This -- Bob Hope or the like -- SERGEANT No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different -- CHIEF Where's it gonna be ? He points -- 27 FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and garnished with concertina wire. It is empty -- DISSOLVE TO : 28 FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert, or child-molester. To counter their need of course are the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep- herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire. 29 FORWARD AREA jammed in the crowd CHEF It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December. CLEAN Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta. CHIEF What cat ? CLEAN One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant. CHIEF I never heard about that. CLEAN Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew. CHEF So what happened ? CLEAN He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back. CHEF Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N. CLEAN Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes. CHIEF They nail him for it bad ? CLEAN He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing -- In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching. All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment. On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a strange silence descends over the men. The door of the copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely quiet the man. He walks over to the microphone. AGENT I'd like to say hello from all of us up here, to all of you out there. All of you who've worked so hard during Operation Brute Force -- Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen -- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors. And I want you to know that we feel proud of you and know how hard your job is. To prove it -- we've brought some entertainment we think you're gonna like: The Playmate of the Year and her two runners up ! He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing "Suzy Q." 30 MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic manner -- smiling. The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental tenderness. Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement their need increases by the square. 31 FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget -- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat, which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows, then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below. Such are the ways of war. CUT TO: 32 EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline. There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle. WILLARD (V.O.) Two days out of Hau Fat, there was nothing but us and the coastline. I felt like I had set off for the center of the earth... Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead. CHIEF Smoke ! WILLARD Where ? They all turn. Chief points up the coast. 33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle. WILLARD Black smoke ... secondary burning. The Chief grabs field glasses. CHIEF Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em. WILLARD First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River. 34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts -- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf. 35 MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW They wade through the water to the beach where they are met by a heavily armed group of men. Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men. We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it. 36 FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out- side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall, strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE -- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache. He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle. His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses. KILGORE (bellowing) Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line back about a hundred yards -- give me some room to breathe. A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off. 37 CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD He was not quite prepared for this. 38 VIEW ON KILGORE turning to his GUARDS KILGORE Bring me some cards. GUARD Sir ? KILGORE Body cards, you damn fool -- cards ! The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance. WILLARD (formally) Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission. KILGORE (not looking up) Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain. He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The others follow, 39 TRACKING VIEW The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on it -- carefully picking out which card he uses. KILGORE (to himself) Six a spades -- eight a hearts -- Isn't one worth a Jack in this whole place. The Colonel goes on about this business. 40 TRACKING ON KILGORE moving through the corpses, dropping the cards. On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers something to him. He stops. KILGORE What ? Here. You sure? The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t Willard. KILGORE (continuing) What's your name, sailor ? LANCE Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir. KILGORE Lance Johnson? The surfer? LANCE That's right, sir. Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand. KILGORE It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is. LANCE Thank you, sir. KILGORE You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot. 41 VIEW ON WILLARD His entire, top priority mission has been put in the background. KILGORE (O.S.) This is Mike from San Diego and Johnny from Malibu -- they're good solid surfers -- none of us are anywhere near your class, though. Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks. WILLARD My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon -- KILGORE Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here. Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in- discriminately on the bodies as they talk. KILGORE (continuing) ... we do a lot of surfing around here. Like to finish up operations early and fly down to Vung Tau for the evening glass. Have you ever surfed the point at Vung Tau? I liked the beach breaks around Na Trang a lot -- good lefts. He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them. KILGORE (continuing) ... we keep three boards in my Command Huey at all times. You never can tell when you're gonna run into something good. I got a guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict a swell two days in advance. We try to work it in. He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses. KILGORE (continuing; to himself) Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw one. He puts the card in the gaping mouth. 42 CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE. KILGORE Where've you been riding, Lance? LANCE I haven't surfed since I got here. KILGORE That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too. DISSOLVE TO : 43 EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by a table set up in front of the command copter. Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map. KILGORE Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for? WILLARD I got bored in Saigon. KILGORE What's the furthest you been in? WILLARD Haiphong. KILGORE Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ? WILLARD No. Walked. KILGORE What'd you do for supplies? WILLARD (he shrugs) Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches. KILGORE Can you trust them? WILLARD No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars. KILGORE Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba. WILLARD When did you hear? KILGORE 'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive? WILLARD Who knows. KILGORE Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz? WILLARD I met him. KILGORE Don't you agree? WILLARD He musta changed ! (pointing to the map) I got to get into the Nung River, here or here. KILGORE That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy. WILLARD Hairy ? KILGORE I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again. WILLARD So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here. KILGORE And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz? WILLARD I met him. KILGORE You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one. WILLARD You'll find enough Cong up there. KILGORE What about this point here? He puts his finger on the map. KILGORE (continuing) What's the name of that goddamn village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook names all sound the same. He motions to one of his surfers. KILGORE (continuing) Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop? MIKE Boss left. KILGORE What do you mean? MIKE It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell. LANCE Nice. Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore. KILGORE Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left. (to Willard) There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break. MIKE It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point. KILGORE How big it is? MIKE Six to eight feet. Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters. KILGORE (to himself) A six-foot left. Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea. LANCE Boss. What's the wind like. MIKE Light off shore -- really hollow. WILLARD We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning. CHIEF The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point. KILGORE Hell, we'll pick your boat up and lay it down like a baby, right where you want it. This is the Cav boy -- airmobile. I can take that point and hold it as long as I like -- and you can get anywhere you want up that river that suits you, Captain. Hell, a six foot left. (he turns to an advisor) You take a gunship back to division -- Mike, take Lance with you -- let him pick out a board, and bring me my Yater Spoon -- the eight six. TOM I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's -- KILGORE (hard) What is it? TOM Well, I mean it's hairy in there -- it's Charlie's point. Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated. WILLARD Charlie don't surf. 44 FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS - DAWN What seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st Cavalry Airmobile -- toughest unit in Vietnam. Kilgore's helicopter is being loaded with ammunition and has surfboards strapped underneath. 45 MED. VIEW Kilgore strides up to the side door, dressed for battle. He looks out, around. He turns to his door GUNNER. KILGORE How do you feel, boy? GUNNER Like a mean motherfucker, sir. He turns to his R.T. man. KILGORE Let's go. 46 FULL VIEW Helicopter rotors build up speed -- gas turbines belching fire from their jet pipes -- dust flying as fifty helicopters rise; ROAR OVER CAMERA and deploy into attack formation. 47 NEW VIEW Helicopters moving THROUGH the FRAME: almost a dance of dragonflies. 48 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD, OTHERS Willard looks ahead -- Kilgore sits near the door. Below they see the jungle whisk by and they are suddenly over the ocean, low and fast. 49 MONTAGE CLOSE SHOTS of rocket pods -- mini-guns in bizarre looking mounts. CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the command helicopter, next to the fearsome weaponry. And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited very few of them really scared -- they fondle their rifles, grenade launchers, anti-personnel grenades, claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers; M-60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars and bayonets. 50 INT. COMMAND COPTER Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch the waves -- then he sits back relaxed. KILGORE (to Willard) We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out. WILLARD Music? KILGORE Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it. 51 MED. SHOT POV behind the PILOT and CO-PILOT -- the ocean rushes below. PILOT Big Duke six to Eagle Thrust -- turn on coordinates 1-0 -- niner, assume attack formation. The helicopter banks into a tight turn and bears toward the coast. RADIO (V.O.) Eagle Thrust formation target 2800 yards -- begin psch-war operations. 52 CLOSE SHOT - LOUDSPEAKERS The ocean rushes below as suddenly the LOUDSPEAKERS BLARE out Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." 53 FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS From the water we SEE the massive grouping of Hueys -- gun- ships -- troop carriers -- medevac and recon -- ROAR over low in battle formation BLARING out "Ride of the Valkyries." 54 INT. HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT -CREW POV behind pilot -- PILOT 700 -- 600 yards -- 500 -- Commence firing. The whole copter shakes. 55 EXT. VIET CONG FISHING VILLAGE - FULL SHOT A Vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the beach and palm trees -- with rice paddies behind. This village commands a delta where ocean and river merge. Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being unloaded. We SEE bunkers with N.V.A. regulars ambling about. Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops; they stare out to see. Men scream orders -- women run from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere there is activity to prepare for the defense of the village. Camouflage is removed from anti-aircraft emplacements. People feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run to tunnels and trenches. The MUSIC GROWS LOUDER with the FAINT SOUND of ROTORS 56 EXT. THE HELICOPTER FORMATION - AERIAL VIEW coming directly at us; WAGNER BLARING. 57 HIGH ANGLE looking down through the helicopters as they approach the village. 58 INT. HELICOPTER - MED.

HELICOPTERS - MONTAGE We SEE rockets ROAR from pods -- MACHINE GUNS RATTLE -- grenade launchers POUND away -- and MINI-GUNS pour streams of lead and tracers with the SOUND of a DIESEL HORN. 60 FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS POV behind lead gunship. They ROAR in over the beach streaming FIRE from doors, pods and nose -- The ground is alive with smoke and fire -- a hut EXPLODES. The leads ship banks sharply up over the trees -- men run below SHOOTING back. 61 MED. SHOT - ANTI-AIRCRAFT EMPLACEMENT EXPLOSIONS crash around -- the MUSIC and SOUND of the COPTERS almost drown them out. The gunner FIRES frantically -- COPTERS are ROARING over -- GUNFIRE rips around. The gunner is blown away. 62 MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD as the ship he is in swoops down, its MACHINE GUNS FIRING into the village. 63 MED. SHOT - SWOOPING COPTER The Pilot leans out and SHOOTS a charging V.C. in the head with his .38, then ducks back in. CO-PILOT We're down, Eagle Thrust -- we're hit. We got a hot L.Z. here. BULLETS RIP through the plexiglass. The Pilot FIRES back. CO-PILOT (continuing) Hell of a hot L.Z. Need immediate air strike on the tree line, Eagle Thrust. 64 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, KILGORE, OTHERS Kilgore has R.T. equipment -- he leans out near the door gunner. KILGORE Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts. RADIO (V.O.) Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it. KILGORE Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line. 65 FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON Four F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the coast. 66 INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE KILGORE Fucking savages. WILLARD Who? KILGORE The enemy. Who else? 67 HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange napalm along the trees. KILGORE (O.S.) (on radio) Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest you follow with cannon fire. 68 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT They circle the battle. RADIO (V.O.) This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left. KILGORE Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you. He turns to door gunner. KILGORE (continuing) Right along the doors, boy. The gunner FIRES leaning out -- KILGORE (continuing) Fine... fine... little higher. Through the roof; yeah, that's good. He leans back in. KILGORE (continuing) Didn't anybody bring me any bombs, grenades, claymores or anything? LIEUTENANT You didn't tell me to, sir. KILGORE (grumbling) You shoulda known. Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore is thrown down where he hangs on. KILGORE (continuing) Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt? WILLARD Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's. KILGORE The trees, eh... He grabs the R.T. KILGORE (continuing) Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees. RADIO (V.O.) Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left. KILGORE Take her in low, Lieutenant. 69 FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS. Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around them -- they scream and fall FIRING back. 70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third. KILGORE Hold it, boy. He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings back inside. KILGORE (continuing) Take her up to 300 feet, Lieutenant. They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's harness. KILGORE (continuing) Rifle. A hand passes him a M-16. KILGORE (continuing; hard) My rifle, soldier. There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300 Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and opens the bolt. 71 VIEW ON WILLARD Amazed at these proceedings. 72 VIEW ON KILGORE as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets into the sling and slams the bolt shut. 73 MOVING POV. ON THE V.C. He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud. The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol. 74 INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy. Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back into the copter. 75 VIEW ON WILLARD The gaudy rifle passed by him. SOLDIER (O.S.) That's 27, sir. WILLARD Anyone got a card? Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from Kilgore. DISSOLVE TO : 76 FULL SHOT - BATTLEFIELD - THE CAV, V.C. Americans run through the hooches FIRING and throwing GRENADES. Helicopters swoop overhead -- JETS ROAR by -- Uniformed N.V.A. regulars burst from a tunnel en- trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut down. 77 INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC. Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle- field. He has the R.T. He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak to Lance. KILGORE The L.Z.'s cooling off fast -- we'll move in another company an' then we'll own it. (he laughs to himself) Charlie's point. He looks out toward the ocean. KILGORE (continuing) Good swell. LANCE What, sir? KILGORE I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it. Lance looks at Willard and then agrees. 78 FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in low over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up at the last minute as the wave breaks. DISSOLVE TO : 79 FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A. regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a southern accent and the prisoners are marched away. Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind. The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the P.B.R. crew. Willard follows. 80 FULL SHOT - THE POINT They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A SHELL SCREAMS overhead. SOLDIER Incoming ! They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set -- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is unmoved. KILGORE Look at that. They look. LANCE This L.Z. is still pretty hot, sir, maybe we oughta stand somewhere else. Kilgore pays him no mention. WILLARD I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel. KILGORE (without looking) It'll get here, soldier. He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the sand. KILGORE (continuing) Change. MIKE Wh -- what? KILGORE Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change. MIKE It's still pretty hairy, sir. KILGORE (bellowing) You want'a surf, soldier? He nods yes meakly. KILGORE (continuing) That's good, boy, because it's either surf or fight. They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from one of the guards. They all think he's going to shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy. KILGORE (continuing) I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's all. He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The Colonel walks over. KILGORE (continuing) You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance? LANCE I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in. A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE. KILGORE Doesn't happen for six hours. Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto his helmet. KILGORE (continuing) The tide -- doesn't come in for six hours. DISSOLVE TO : 81 FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY They walk through shallows carrying brightly colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by carrying out wounded. They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak. 82 FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the beautiful waves breaking beyond them. 83 CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing hard and constantly looking around scared out of their minds. 84 MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole. KILGORE They far enough? LANCE Sure -- fine -- Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from a waiting lackey. KILGORE (through megaphone) That's far enough -- pick one up and come on in -- 85 FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS They line themselves up on the point. A good set is building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off -- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking around frantically. 86 CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach. Lance looks over at Willard. LANCE (to himself) Maybe he'll get tubed. WILLARD What? LANCE Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him. A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in. WILLARD Incoming ! Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water are HEARD. KILGORE Son of a bitch. Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror. 87 FULL SHOT - THE POINT Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down on the waves. 88 MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE LANCE (to himself) The tragedy of this war is a dead surfer. Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy, too. WILLARD What's that? LANCE Just something I read in the Free Press. KILGORE They just missed a good set -- the chicken shits ! Lance looks up. 89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke hangs over the water. KILGORE (O.S.) (megaphone) Try it again, you little bastards. 90 BACK TO SCENE He turns to Willard. KILGORE (continuing) I´m not afraid to surf this place. I'll surf this place. 91 CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE He turns, glowering to his lackeys. KILGORE Bring that R.T., soldier. He grabs it. KILGORE (continuing) Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels -- Goddamit, I want that treeline bombed -- yeah -- napalm -- gimme some napalm -- son of a bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z. or C.B.U.'s if you got any of them -- just bomb 'em into the Stone Age, boy. He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO WHISTLES over -- everyone drops. KILGORE (continuing; to himself) Son of a bitch. As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un- intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his rifle turning to Lance -- KILGORE (continuing) We'll have this place cleaned up and ready for us in a jiffy, boy. Don't you worry. He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead. 92 FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us -- The P.B.R. hangs below it. The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows. The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists -- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still going on around them. They all look up as a wadge of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to begin their bombing run. 93 FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units) and finally an immense amount of NAPALM. 94 FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R. The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so- often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns out almost everything. CHIEF Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot. CLEAN Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain? CHIEF I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point -- Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS. CHIEF (continuing) Let's just get outta here. 95 FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE, OTHERS Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses -- smoke drifts over. Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust- ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance goes further downriver through the black smoke and there merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat. WILLARD (to Lance) Look. There it is; the boat. Lance looks over -- a tremendous relief on his face. But still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward the boat. LANCE (whispers) He'll kill us. WILLARD He can't kill us. (realizing as he says it) We're on his side. Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then strides back without looking at them. KILGORE (almost to himself) You smell that. (louder) You smell that? LANCE What? KILGORE Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that -- They reflect the glow from the burning trees. KILGORE (continuing; nostalgically) I love the smell of napalm in the morning. One time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours. I walked up it when it was all over; we didn't find one of 'em ... not one stinking gook body. They slipped out in the night -- but the smell -- that gasoline smell -- the whole hill -- it smelled like ... (pause) victory... He looks off nostalgically. WILLARD You know, some day this war's gonna end.. KILGORE (sadly) Yes, I know. Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts them up in the air. KILGORE (continuing) The wind -- LANCE What? Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases. KILGORE (rising maniacally) Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's blowing on shore -- It's on shore ! He leans down and practically grabs Lance. KILGORE (continuing; screaming) It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ... WILLARD The kid can't ride sloppy waves. They turn and stare out to sea. 96 FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their boards, overjoyed. WILLARD (O.S.) The kid can't stand sloppy waves. 97 MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD WILLARD You don't expect this kid to ride that crap, do you? He's a goddamn artist, he needs something to work with... Slapping Lance on the shoulder. LANCE Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit ! KILGORE (apologetically) Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel. He turns toward the trees. KILGORE (continuing) It's the napalm -- it's causing the wind -- ruining my perfect left. He staggers off toward the trees followed by his guards and other lackeys. KILGORE (continuing; mumbling) The napalm -- ruin -- napalm my perfect left -- my perfect left point break -- napalm -- Lance motions with his eyes to Willard. 98 FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R. The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and crew waiting and yelling. 99 MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE WILLARD Are you finished surfing? LANCE Yeah... thanks. WILLARD Want to say goodbye to the Colonel? LANCE Nah. WILLARD Then let's get the hell out of here. They break and run like hell toward the boat in the distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some- thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards -- Willard looks at them. LANCE No -- no, Captain. WILLARD Which one's the Colonel's? LANCE The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer. Willard glances over to it with determination. There is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it. CHIEF (O.S.) Incoming ! Incoming -- son of a bitch. The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand. Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the board. WILLARD (calm) This one , Lance? LANCE Yeah, Jesus Christ ! Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat, through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr. Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and relieved. CLEAN What'd you that for? WILLARD When I was a kid I, never had a Yater spoon. Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount. The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF toward the deeper water of the river -- the board clearly visible on the stern. DISSOLVE TO : 100 FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed. It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy fire. 101 MED. SHOT ON THE CREW They all are in full battle positions -- their twin fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready. Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back from his forward turret. LANCE (yelling) Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater. WILLARD He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down. They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst. WILLARD (continuing) Let's put some distance between us and Charlie. The Chief nods. CHIEF Lance --- LANCE Yeah. CHIEF Why don't you roll us a big joint? I think the Captain'd like that. They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful pause, Willard smiles: WILLARD Take one a mine -- He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights up. DISSOLVE TO : 102 FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed. DISSOLVE TO : 103 FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT The boat is hidden under some trees along the river bank. The men wait tensely listening -- LANCE You hear it again? WILLARD No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back. LANCE You think he'd of shot us? WILLARD When? LANCE Any time -- us -- Americans. Lance looks over at Willard. WILLARD I don't think he´d of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board -- LANCE A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here. WILLARD He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants. CHEF Can I go get those mangos now? CHIEF I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile -- LANCE Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff? WILLARD Sure. LANCE And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped? WILLARD It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying. CLEAN How can you tell their weapons.. an' how far they're going? Willard smiles. WILLARD Mostly from the imprints when they put them down to rest. their morale from the way they drag their feet, or the joints that may be lying around. If they're near a base camp, they wouldn't be conserving food; they'll be throwing it away half-eaten. If the branches aren't broken, their weapons are slung. But all this is just technique.. There's a feeling you get after a while, that's what's important. I was going through a village once. I was looking for a certain party. I took off my boots, and walked into each hut. It was midnight. I went into three like that and suddenly I realized I´d gone into each hut the same way -- standing up -- so the next one I went in on my belly. An RPD burst took out the door a bit above my head. (he shrugs) Things like that. A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted -- They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead. KILGORE (V.O.) (over a loudspeaker) I'm not gonna hurt or harm you, boy -- I just want the board back -- You can understand -- It was one of my best -- You know how hard it is to get a board you like, boy. I'm not gonna hurt or harm you -- Just leave it where I can find it -- The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise ceases. CLEAN Jesus -- that guy's too damn much. CHIEF I wonder if that was the same copter. WILLARD He's probably got 'em all over the river with that recording. We better move now while it's dark. Chef steps forward with a plastic basket. CHIEF Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you -- WILLARD I'll go with him -- They all look at him. WILLARD (continuing) I wanta get my feet on solid land once in awhile -- He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side. 104 MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT They cautiously walk through the underbrush. WILLARD Chef. CHEF Yes, sir -- WILLARD Why they call you that? CHEF Call me what, sir? WILLARD Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff? CHEF No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere -- WILLARD A sauciere -- CHEF That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food. WILLARD What are you doing out here? CHEF Cook school -- that did it. WILLARD How? CHEF They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school. They move into a slight clearing. WILLARD (whispering) -- quiet -- Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges- tures that he heard something; he points. 105 MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef. WILLARD (silent) There... He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover the spot. A few yards from them they hear something move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles. He and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass, and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he wants. He makes another command and they rush the trapped enemy. 106 MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly, emptying their clips. CHEF It's a motherfucking tiger -- goddamn... He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a man can be. CHEF (continuing; screaming) Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger -- motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh -- Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared out of his head as well. 107 FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it. CHEF (hysterical) Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn ! It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ ! Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh. The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night. LANCE What's this tiger shit? WILLARD No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him. LANCE You think? WILLARD I wasn´t looking.. I was running. CLEAN Was a big tiger -- no shit? WILLARD Who stopped to measure him -- let's get the hell out of here. CHEF A motherfucking tiger -- I could've been killed. The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great speed. CHIEF You forgot the mangoes, didn't you? CHEF Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat. They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle. WILLARD (V.O.) He was right, the Chef -- never go into the jungle, unless you're ready to go all the way. DISSOLVE TO : 108 EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns around, and we SEE his face. WILLARD (V.O.) What was in the jungle? What was there, waiting for me? He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating his face momentarily. There is something different about him; a maturity, a cool inner peace. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... Kurtz was in there. Or was he; was it Kurtz? He was just a name to me now; I couldn't remember a face, a voice -- he just didn't add up to me. all his liberal bullshit about the end of savagery -- and the role of our culture, our way of life... Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat -- there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) Our way of life -- I really started to look forward to meeting Kurtz again. DISSOLVE TO : 109 WATERWAY - MOVING FORWARD - DAY We HEAR: RADIO -- must remember that we owe our thanks for these to the wonderful services of the U.S.O. -- here's another oldie -- this one dedicated... 110 VIEW ON CHEF by himself on the P.B.R.; he has wiped mud under his eyes to kill the glare; it is incredibly hot. He is barechested, wearing a hat made of a banana palm. RADIO ... to the fire team at An Khe from their groovy C.O. Fred the Head -- 111 VIEW ON THE GROUP RADIO The Rolling Stones and "Satisfaction..." CHEF Outa sight. The SONG BLARES ON -- they all dig it. PAN TO Willard, sitting alone in the rear, reading from his file on Kurtz. We REVEAL Lance in the b.g., water- skiing behind the P.B.R., slaloming back and forth on his single ski to the MUSIC -- jumping the wake occasion- ally. 112 NEW VIEW - ON THE P.B.R. Lance waterskiing to "Satisfaction." 113 VIEW ON CLEAN alert, at the rear of the boat -- his M-16 ready, just in case. 114 VIEW ON WILLARD Willard opens a letter from the packet. We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine writing on the envelope. WILLARD (V.O.) The dossier of A Dtachment contained letters from the families and wives of Kurtz' men There were letters from Kurtz' wife as well. 115 CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner is the return addess of Mrs. Colonel Walter Kurtz -- Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year old American Beauty... She is classically American. 116 CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD looking at the picture -- puts it back, then opens the letter, straightens it. WILLARD (V.O.) Dearest Walt -- I have to confess something. I know how you feel about this, but I had to ask Bob to find out what he could -- I just couldn't stand it anymore, not knowing where you are, whether you're alive or dead. I'm sorry Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob didn't tell me anything -- he said he couldn't -- I can't stand it anymore, Walt -- I just can't stand it. Willard looks out at the jungle. Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) I have to take the kids to school every morning now -- carpools just never work out. Jeff came home with a black eye on Tuesday but said he won anyway. He wouldn't tell me what the fight was about. Jeff keeps asking where you are -- he has maps of Viet Nam in his room now. He misses you very much. I can't take this much longer, Walt. I love you and I just can't stand it. 117 CLOSE ON WILLARD He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic- ular. It reads: Sell the house Sell the car Sell the kids Find someone else Forget it I'm never coming back Forget it -- He folds up the letter. 118 CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD He looks out at the ominous jungled mountains. DISSOLVE TO : 119 FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER OUTPOST - RAIN The P.B.R. pulls in towards an American outpost that is being used as a forward medical evacuation center. Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli- copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain- coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up. 120 MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass. WILLARD Soldier -- where'´s your C.O.? SOLDIER Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell -- WILLARD Well , who's in command here? SOLDIER I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man -- He turns and walks off babbling incoherently -- WILLARD What about you, soldier? The soldier he was talking to turns around smiling idiotically and making animal noises. He stumbles off after his friend. 121 MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - WILLARD He looks around disgustedly VOICE (O.S.) (whispering) Captain -- Willard turns around looking for where the voice came from. VOICE (O.S.) (continuing) Over here, Captain -- He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions Willard into the tent. 122 INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT They duck inside -- it is dark and damp. On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over the situation. AGENT You came in on that boat, didn't you? WILLARD Yeah -- AGENT Where are you headed? WILLARD What's it matter? Get to the point. AGENT Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of -- WILLARD Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat. They all look over. AGENT Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh -- WILLARD Captain Willard -- go ahead. AGENT Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning. WILLARD Yeah. AGENT Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days. WILLARD Dreadful. AGENT Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat. WILLARD Well -- AGENT We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here. WILLARD We need all our fuel. He turns and starts to leave. AGENT But, Captain, think what these girls have done for the boys -- think of how they've risked -- Willard is almost out of the tent. TERRI Captain -- He turns around. TERRI (continuing) It's really rough here -- Captain -- we're just not built for it -- The Pilot laughs. PILOT That's rich -- TERRI Do us a favor -- I'd do one for you -- if I could -- Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others. AGENT Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life. WILLARD I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes -- AGENT Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell -- WILLARD I like all of them -- AGENT Good -- like I said, take your pick. WILLARD I said I like all of them. AGENT Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull? Willard turns to leave again. WILLARD We need all our fuel anyway. AGENT Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that -- WILLARD Sit down -- we'll talk about it. Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent to do likewise. AGENT What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me. WILLARD My men -- AGENT What ! WILLARD That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men -- The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening -- the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself. AGENT You're out of your skull -- WILLARD We have a lot of pride in our unit -- AGENT How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think -- WILLARD Esprit de corps -- AGENT No -- absolutely not -- WILLARD One for all -- all for one -- AGENT You can keep your fucking fuel -- Willard gets up. WILLARD You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together. AGENT Get out -- WILLARD Men of all races -- nationalities -- He gets up and starts out. AGENT Two drums -- Willard turns around slowly. AGENT (continuing) Two whole drums -- WILLARD We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too -- AGENT I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked -- WILLARD I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em -- He turns to go under the tent flap. WILLARD (continuing) Have the girls freshen up a bit -- comb their hair -- put on something -- you know what I mean -- He leaves. 123 FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16. CLEAN You keep this thing in this condition an' it's gonna jam, Lance -- mark my words. LANCE Why don't you go pet the water buffaloes -- get off my back. Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their sides the words have been stenciled in black: 1 Each -- Buffalo, Water B-1A U.S. Army No. 15239 Willard walks through them down to the boat. CHIEF Careful, Captain, they've been known to charge. WILLARD All right I got a little surprise for you -- They all look up. WILLARD (continuing) I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel -- CHEF No shit. WILLARD Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there. CHEF I don't believe you -- CHIEF What're you trying to say, Captain -- WILLARD You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor -- CHIEF No shit -- hot damn -- 124 INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - LYNDA, CHEF He has followed her into the tent awe-struck -- she casuallu starts unbuttoning her fatigue jacket and taking off her pants. he just stands there, his arms at his sides. CHEF I've got every one of your pictures -- I've got the centerfold -- the Playmate's review -- the Playmate of the Year run-off -- everything, even the calender -- LYNDA Well, get undressed and let's get it over with -- CHEF I can't believe it -- I'd a never even got to see you if it wasn't for this war -- She lies down on the cot in only her panties. CHEF (continuing) You wouldn't mind -- uh kinda draping that jacket over you sort of the way you were in the calender, would you? LYNDA Come on -- cut this crap -- I gotta get back to Saigon -- CHEF Just let me look awhile -- I just don't believe -- CUT TO: 125 INT.

LANCE Well -- uh thanks -- see you around. CATHY Yeah. He leaves -- she pulls herself up and starts combing her hair -- Mr. Clean walks in. CATHY (continuing) Who are you? CLEAN I'm next -- She shrugs. DISSOLVE TO : 126 INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, TERRI He finishes tying on his boots -- pulls on his jacket -- his gun belt and picks up his M-16. She looks up at him -- WILLARD Ma'am -- I'd like to thank you for what you an' all your friends have done for us -- I want you to know that me an' the men appreciate you coming all this way -- riskin' your lives -- living uncomfortably an' doing all you can to entertain us. I want you to know personally, Miss, that for the past few minutes you have made me feel at home. She picks up a shoe to throw at him. he turns, exits f.g. WILLARD (continuing) Just wanted to say that, ma'am. The SHOE CLANGS off his helmet. CUT TO: 127 EXT. THE P.B.R. APPROACHING DO LUNG BRIDGE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the night. WILLARD (V.O.) Two days and nights later, we approach the Do Lung Bridge. 128 VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere -- scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R. edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness. SOLDIER I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay -- I got money. CHIEF Get away from this boat. WILLARD Who's your C.O., soldier? The Soldier ducks back and runs away. SOLDIER Fuck you, you'll get what's coming to you. Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps forward. LIEUTENANT Captain Willard? WILLARD That's me. LIEUTENANT Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then -- He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings, Willard takes it. LIEUTENANT (continuing) You don't know how happy that makes me, sir. WILLARD Why? LIEUTENANT Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out. WILLARD We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand? LIEUTENANT I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard -- WILLARD What is this bridge? LIEUTENANT It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded. He points to the men getting ready to work. LIEUTENANT (continuing) Every night we build it and by 0800 they've blown it up -- it and a lot of good men -- But the generals like to say the road is open -- ha ! Nobody uses that road except Charlie. He turns and splashes off into the darkness. LIEUTENANT (continuing) This is the cesspool of hell. SOLDIER (O.S.) Incoming. SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous. CHIEF (yelling) All right -- Lance, go with the Captain an' see what you can scrounge -- Willard climbs out with Lance. CHIEF (continuing; to Willard) Better make it fast, sir -- we don't really need much anyway. Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the bridge. 129 MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they don't know where to run. VOICE Straight ahead, son of a bitch. They dive towards the voice. 130 CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his buddy who is crying uncontrollably. SOLDIER You came right to it, son of a bitch -- WILLARD Son of a bitch, sir. The Soldier doesn't respond. WILLARD (continuing) Where's your chief supply officer? SOLDIER Beverly Hills -- WILLARD What? SOLDIER Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be? WILLARD C'mon -- There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP from a sandbagged emplacement. SOLDIER (O.S.) Get your asses down, buddy. They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner. Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard trips. VOICE Watch your feet, asshole -- Willard looks down. VOICE (continuing) You stepped on my face. LANCE We thought you were dead. VOICE The whole world loves a smart ass. They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to himself. WILLARD What're you shooting at, soldier? GUNNER Gooks. He turns and sees it's an officer. GUNNER (continuing) I´m sorry, sir. WILLARD It's all right, sergeant -- what's out there? GUNNER They were tryin' to cut through the wire -- I got 'em all I think. OTHER SOLDIER Oh yeah -- listen. There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it stops for aminute then continues hideously. GUNNER He's trying to call his friends -- send up a flare. The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST. SPOTTER Those are all dead, stupid, he's obviously underneath 'em -- They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING gets more intense. GUNNER Wake up the Roach. The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are the words: "GOD BLESS DOW." ROACH Yeah, man. SPOTTER Slope in the wire -- hear him. He listens, he does, he nods. SPOTTER (continuing) Bust him. Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley designs all over it. GUNNER Hear him? ROACH Sure , yeah. GUNNER You need a flare -- ROACH No, it´s cool. He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the SCREAM, calculating. ROACH (continuing) He's close -- real close. He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or pieces of bodies coming down around them. ROACH (continuing) Muhhh Fuhhh ... He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep. 131 FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance. Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance. CHEF Geez, I wish they'd hurry. A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start building the bridge. SOLDIER Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh? CLEAN Yeah, it still runs. SOLDIER Do me a favor buddy, please. CLEAN What is it? He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes. SOLDIER Send these out when you get back to the world. He puts them in Clean's hand. SOLDIER (continuing) It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know. CLEAN What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow. SOLDIER Nobody comes in here. He points up at the mountain ridges. SOLDIER (continuing) The N.V.A. 312th -- over there the 307th -- on that hill we counted fourteen different guns in one minute -- they got rockets mortars, snipers in those trees, there's a million of those shitty little bastards out there -- we're all gonna die. He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency. SOLDIER (continuing) I'm gonna be dead. Clean takes the letters. SOLDIER (continuing) You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river. CLEAN We ain't goin' down the river. The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking. CLEAN (continuing) What's up river from here anyhow -- The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded. SOLDIER Spooky. CLEAN Charlie? SOLDIER No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back. He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra M-16's. CHIEF Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh? WILLARD We found some bodies -- let's get out a here. 132 FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R. They edge through the shallows as the men light up their welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge -- then pull away and accelerate fast. 133 MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW The Chief is at the helm -- they all look back in the distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS. DISSOLVE TO : 134 EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount. 135 EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de- bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R. CHIEF (to Willard) I can't see a fucking thing. There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard climbs forward, and looks down. CHIEF (continuing) We hit a big enough one this hull will shatter like a Corvette. Fucking plastic boat. Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole, warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean joins him, helping. WILLARD (shouting to Chief) What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down? CHIEF Who knows what's up there? WILLARD Can't be any worse than this. What do you think? CHIEF I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse. Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth of a tributary. WILLARD Well, get in there. CHIEF This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes. There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks. WILLARD Get in there ! CHIEF This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party. WILLARD Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river. It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't do as he says. CHIEF (finally relents, turns the helm) You're fucking crazy. You're going to get us all killed. The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth of the tributary. DISSOLVE TO : 136 EXT. THE TRIBUTARY - P.B.R. - RAIN Rain is pouring down, but the P.B.R. is slowed down to a snail's pace by Hyacinths, literally across the waterway. Willard, Chef and Clean in the water, cutting through them with machetes. 137 VIEW ON LANCE having climbed to the highest point of the cockpit. LANCE It breaks through in about twenty feet. 138 VIEW ON WILLARD cutting through. he looks to Chef, who has stopped cut- ting, and is staring into the jungle. WILLARD What do you see? CHEF I don't know. He looks out -- the jungle at this point is very dark and high -- totally impenetrable. WILLARD Keep cutting. They work feverishly, knowing something is wrong. 139 VIEW ON CHEF cutting with all he's got. CHEF I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us. WILLARD Probably is. CHEF Whatdoya think it thinks. WILLARD That we're dumber than we look. Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them. It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later. Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon. CHIEF Lance -- 'bout twenty meters starboard. Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free. CHEF There in the trees ! Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull. 140 VIEW ON LANCE Lance's twin guns return the FIRE. The Chief moves to one of the heavy guns and joins Lance in returning the FIRE. 141 VIEW ON THE MEN IN THE WATER pushing, cutting. Bullets SMASH and EXPLODE around. Clean climbs onto the boat, and leaps onto a gun emplace- ment. 142 MED. VIEW Nobody really knows where the erratic fire is coming from. CHIEF (back at the helm) Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another. CHEF Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash. Lance grits his teeth, FIRING -- 143 CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN 144 POV BEHIND CLEAN He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction -- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy burst at the jungle -- trees crumble. CLEAN I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a- bitch, it's jammed, oh God, it's jammed. Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE. Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead. He looks angrily to Willard. Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward the cockpit. WILLARD Throw me that ordnance. Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over the edge of the cockpit. WILLARD (continuing) Give me some kind a field a fire -- BULLETS rip by. CHEF (exhausted) We're through. He climbs aboard and collapses. CHEF (continuing) Oh, God -- LANCE (FIRING) I ain't finished ! I ain't finished ! WILLARD Bring that bow ordnance into those trees. He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and FIRES -- there is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the jungle. 145 POV. - BEHIND THEM He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly. There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin- ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES. 146 CLOSE SHOT ON THE CHIEF He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead. Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79. 147 FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R. The boat slams through the hyacinth growth, moving through the river, FIRING BACK at unseen enemy in the jungle. DISSOLVE TO : 148 FULL VIEW ON THE P.B.R. - TWILIGHT The boat moves ahead at half speed through a wide, flat area in the river. 149 MED. VIEW The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded. They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be- cause they know they're too far from the banks to be shot at. They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount. The boat is a floating wreck. Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack by Chief. All of the men are silent. Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the shoulder. CHEF There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell. WILLARD How much is left? CHEF Less than half -- sure is a mess down there. Chief has been silent by the body of Clean in a plastic sack. WILLARD And the grass? CHEF Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other. Chief pushes Clean's body into the river. 150 VIEW ON WILLARD He notices something in the distance. 151 WILLARD'S POV A light. 152 MED. VIEW Willard stands up, pointing up the river. WILLARD Hey. They all look over. WILLARD (continuing) That's a light down there -- CHEF Yeah, it is. CHIEF What the hell is it? WILLARD In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light. 153 FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. - THE TWILIGHT The P.B.R. approaches the distant light -- which seems to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building. 154 VIEW ON WILLARD, CHIEF straining to see; he uses field glasses. 155 POV - THROUGH THE GLASSES Seems to be some figures standing on the dock. The figures pull back behind some drums. 156 BACK TO SCENE WILLARD Watch it ! They duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns trained on the dock as the boat still approaches. WILLARD (continuing) They're not Cong. CHIEF (over the loud-hailer) We're Americans. Another BURST, closer. CHEF Maybe you shouldn't say we're Americans? Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure it out. WILLARD Chef, try your French. Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts: CHEF Nous sommes Americains -- Silence. CHEF (continuing) Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser. 157 VIEW ON WILLARD He looks through the glasses. 158 POV THROUGH THE GLASSES Gradually, a small group appears from behind the drums on the dock. WILLARD (O.S.) French Nationals -- they may not be too friendly, though. 159 BACK TO SCENE We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying speaking French. CHEF Nous sommes Americains -- nous sommes des amis -- There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then: FRENCHMAN (shouting out) Vous parlez Francais comme une vache espanole. CHEF (to himself) I thought it was pretty good, myself. CHIEF What'd he say? CHEF Said I speak French like a Spanish cow. FRENCHMAN (O.S.) Laisser tomber vos armes -- CHEF Put the guns straight up -- stand away from the mounts. WILLARD Do it. They do. FRENCHMAN (O.S.) Vous pouvez approcher mais doucement -- CHEF Take her in slow. 160 FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para- troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear- ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle- aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli- cate, with a strength about him. PHILIPPE Hands on the heads. CHIEF I can't steer with my goddamn feet. CHEF Hey, they speak American. GASTON Who is the commanding officer? CHIEF I -- WILLARD I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold. GASTON Philippe -- Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope from the deck and ties it to the dock. LANCE I'll help you with -- PHILIPPE Do not move -- Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly. GASTON Fifty calibers, eh, Captain -- WILLARD As I said, we can pay you in gold. GASTON Entirely unnecessary, Captain. He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise -- GASTON We share a common enemy -- you are our guests. (he steps back) I am Gaston de marais -- this is my family's plantation. It has been such for 121 years. It will be such after I die. This is my son, Philippe -- he has fought in Algeria and held the rank of Captain. And Henry LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was at Dien Bien Phu. My personal servant, Tran Van Kac --- Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit and three women come forward from different positions -- all wear bush clothing and bear weapons. GASTON (continuing) My youngest son -- Christian -- 161 CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of ammunition trailing off behind him. GASTON Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie -- A tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an M-16. GASTON (continuing) And my youngest daughter -- Claudine. 162 CLOSE ON CLAUDINE an attractive girl about eighteen. She wears a red paratrooper beret and a well-fitted bush suit. She carries an M-79 grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition. 163 FULL VIEW - P.B.R. - CREW, GASTON, OTHERS They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits, heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them. They look the Americans over warily and assemble at Philippe's command. WILLARD American weapons? GASTON We took them from the dead. (smiles) Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner. CHEF Shower. Willard's men look at one another, dazed. WILLARD We don't want to bother you any, we -- GASTON A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain. Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks up his M-16 by the stock. WILLARD A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand. GASTON Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity. The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and follow. CHIEF What about the boat? PHILIPPE My men will keep it for you -- CHIEF Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the boat. WILLARD Chief. (pause) Come with us. They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs and follows. 164 FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc- ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire. GASTON A suitable accomodation for your men, captain -- you will, of course, be quartered with us -- He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The Chief is hesitant. WILLARD Go ahead -- Philippe leads them on, muttering. GASTON Captain, this way. Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns. Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride. GASTON (continuing) Magnificent, eh, Captain? Willard looks. GASTON (continuing) It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused -- WILLARD Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb. GASTON No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better. (pause) My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent. Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard looks between him and this big hole in the ground in amezement. 165 INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted. Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy, caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened, reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him. CHEF A hot shower, hot damn. He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a shower is. 166 EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese guard at the boat. 167 INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still elegantly furnished, although old and decaying. Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of the room, looking out over the carpet, the bed with its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and burns. He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above which is a large mirror. There is an album on the marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random. 168 VIEW ON WILLARD haggard, looking down at the album. WILLARD (V.O.) I wondered -- how long has this room been like this; how long has the furniture been standing in these places? 169 VIEW ON THE ALBUM Some old photographs of people standing around a car in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the plantation. WILLARD (V.O.) Was it like this sixty years ago? Eighty years? But here, even eighty years is nothing. He turns the page, The plantation being built. Pictures of the framing, skeletal against the sky and jungle. 170 VIEW ON WILLARD fascinated WILLARD (V.O.) It was jungle, once; and it will be jungle, again... 171 VIEW ON THE ALBUM Onlu the very beginnings of the house; the first struc- tures. Then another picture of the jungle site where it was to be built. 172 CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish mirror. He barely recognizes himself. 173 MED. VIEW Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out- of-time room. 174 INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food. The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group. The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights up as he regards the wonderful European-style food. CHEF This food is wonderful ! I can't believe the chef is a slope. (turning to Clean) Some more? Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands. CHEF (continuing) Hey -- Lance. LANCE Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya .. wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni, please. And then he looks to his friends for approval. Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain there is another, more elaborate table, where the De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the group. The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room. Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair next to him. GASTON Roxanne, I hope you are feeling better. ROXANNE Je vais bien maintenant. GASTON May I present Captain Willard? He is of a paratroop regiment. You know the difference between a paratrooper and a regular soldier, don't you , my dear? ROXANNE (smiling and taking Willard's hand) Yes, they come from the sky. She sits -- there's an uneasy silence. Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne. WILLARD I would like to know more about the .. uh, plaque... Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted wooden plaque with various tallies on it. GASTON Attacks repulsed, as I was saying. (hard) This is only for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise. (pause) Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain. WILLARD Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here. GASTON Captain? WILLARD You'll get blown outta here some day. GASTON We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that. WILLARD The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too. GASTON But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree. WILLARD I always thought the French came here to get the rubber. PHILIPPE Excuse me, I must attend to my men. He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife. ROXANNE May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat? WILLARD We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am. GASTON Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle. WILLARD Do you know that jungle? GASTON When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man. WILLARD What about an American named Kurtz? There is a pause. GASTON We have never heard of him. Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand. GASTON (continuing) Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit, Captain. Willard turns. WILLARD Good night. Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The servants clear the table. ROXANNE You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son. WILLARD I'm sorry to hear that. ROXANNE (rising) Cognac? WILLARD I should be checking on the boat. ROXANNE The war will still be here tomorrow. She walks out of the room. WILLARD (thinking) I guess so. He follows. 175 INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands. ROXANNE Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there? WILLARD No. Not really. I was discharged from the army four years ago. I went home, wasted some time, bought a Mustang Mach 1, drove it a week. Then I re-upped for another tour. No, everything I love is here. ROXANNE Then you are like us. She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit. ROXANNE (continuing) What will you do after the war? WILLARD I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones. ROXANNE What's a big question? WILLARD Kurtz. (pause) I know you've heard of him. ROXANNE Yes. WILLARD What did you hear? ROXANNE That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz. WILLARD What things? ROXANNE Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain. WILLARD Yes. ROXANNE Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages? WILLARD I know. ROXANNE But Captain, I mean -- cannibals. A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for him. ROXANNE (continuing) What a pity, you don't drink. Since my husband died, there are so many things I must do alone. She takes a sip. Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace overlooking the river. 176 EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover- ing the front of house, from the river. ROXANNE (from the sitting room) Are you warm, Captain? WILLARD The river is beautiful. In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat. 177 WILLARD'S POV. The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's Vietnamese. 176 MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes up behind him. ROXANNE I spend hours watching that river from my bedroom window. It fascinates me. She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is kissing her. 179 CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE One eye steals another look at the P.B.R. 180 VIEW ON THE P.B.R. Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready for the long night. 181 VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting room, and up the stairs. 182 INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire -- there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one. He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and stands there facing him. He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays down on the bed and watches him. ROXANNE I have been lonely here, Captain. He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is leaning against the wall in his reach. FADE OUT. 183 EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure kneeling in final preparations for going out in the night. Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing into the darkness. 184 EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first, the first disappears into the thicket. 185 CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently, he drags the body out of sight. 186 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R. The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears into the hold. 187 NEW VIEW He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly, with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his best work alone, and at night. CUT TO. 188 INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles. ROXANNE I will fix you breakfast. He starts to get up. WILLARD I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta -- ROXANNE Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order. He stops -- seemingly stunned. WILLARD So that's it. ROXANNE You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much. She turns to go. WILLARD What if I say no. ROXANNE Then Philippe will have to kill all of you. She leaves. 189 EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring ammunition boxes. Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the Chief and crew with M-16's. GASTON Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions. WILLARD Your daughter. CHIEF They taking half our ammo, Captain -- said it was your orders. He pauses for a second. WILLARD That's right -- I did. The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston. WILLARD I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh? GASTON We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets. (pause) Au revoir, Captain. 190 LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. Willard climbs on board and it pulls away. 191 EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment. CHIEF Next time we get in a good fire fight -- I'd like to know how she was, Captain. Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains the contents of all those ammo boxes. .50 calibre; clips; grenades. CHEF Holy shit. CLEAN What did you put in all those ammo boxes? WILLARD Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted. CHIEF When'd you do it? WILLARD While you were sleeping. He lets the board drop. Willard moves to the back of the boat. 192 FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth, just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half speed, alert, ready for anything. WILLARD (V.O.) We moved deeper and deeper into the jungle. It was very quiet there. It was like wandering on a prehistoric planet, an unknown world ... where the men thought they crawled to, I don't know. For me, we crawled toward Kurtz -- exclusively. Willard looks out ahead and points. They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank. 193 FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE 194 POV. OF THE P.B.R. They pass in front of the village which is rundown and completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what they once were. CHEF (O.S.) Flood. CHIEF (O.S.) No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease. WILLARD (O.S.) I don't know -- there'd still be some sign -- it's just like the one this morning. DISSOLVE TO : 195 POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting. 196 FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi- dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A gateway to paradise. The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way. The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon it and has never known such a sense of peace and well- being. Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into hell. Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves. The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this hole. DISSOLVE TO : 197 FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet. CHIEF -- All right, Lance -- Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The smoke clears. LANCE The other one -- WILLARD No -- leave it -- CHIEF Why -- Charlie put it there to kill -- WILLARD Thta's not Charlie's work -- There is silence. WILLARD Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs -- CHIEF Signs? WILLARD Yeah -- like keep out -- Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead past the smoking mound. 198 EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast. WILLARD (V.O.) Toward the night of the fifth day out of Do Lung Bridge, we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz' base. Everything was still, the trees, the creepers, even the brush seemed like it had been changed into some kind of stone. It was unnatural, like a trance. Not a sound could be heard. I began to think I was deaf -- then the fog came suddenly, and I was blind too. The boat disappears in the thick fog. 199 MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close. WILLARD Listen. CHIEF What is it? WILLARD Listen. They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of HUNDREDS OF MEN. CHIEF They're on the banks of the river. 200 VIEW ON LANCE Frantically, he swings the twin fifties around. LANCE Jesus ! 201 VIEW ON CHIEF We can barely SEE him -- in and out of the fog. CHIEF No, Lance. Not while you can't see. 202 VIEW ON WILLARD listening. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING. CHIEF Will they attack? WILLARD If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore. CHEF God... LANCE Sounds like hundreds of them. WILLARD Shhhhhh. The CHORUS OF GROANS in unbearable. But it is not ahostile cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the SOUND OF HUMAN ANGUISH. WILLARD (continuing) It doesn't sound hostile -- it sounds like they've seen us coming and it sounds like -- I don't know, a funeral. I don't understand. 203 VIEW ON LANCE A glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses, fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R. DISSOLVE TO : 204 MED. VIEW - THE P.B.R. MOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds cautiously. WILLARD (V.O.) Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river. CHIEF Which way? Right or left? WILLARD Who knows? Right. CHIEF Looks pretty shallow. The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef takes a long pole and begins sounding depth. 205 VIEW ON WILLARD The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung. Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him. WILLARD (reading) Upon reaching objective. Target key personnel and commence operation. Should difficulty arise from which extraction is impossible, break radio silence Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm -- indicate purgative air strike -- code -- Street Gang. (pause) Purgative air strike ! Purgative ! They'd kill me too ! Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R. rattling against the boat. CHIEF Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're shooting fucking arrows at us. 206 CLOSE ON WILLARD looking toward the banks. 207 WILLARD'S POV Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them. 208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R. crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the childish assault. WILLARD Steer her right. 209 VIEW ON THE P.B.R. arrows hitting the deck. The men open up everything they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly. WILLARD Keep going.. keep going. They're just fucking sticks ! Chief, stay at the helm. But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands, and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in horror. 210 VIEW ON CHIEF laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him, bleeding onto Willard's boots. He looks up at Willard, about to say something. CHIEF A spear? He dies. 211 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R. The men are still crazily FIRING into the empty jungle long after those who attacked beat their retreat. WILLARD Stop it. Stop it ! Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off. LANCE Chief's dead. Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot in his hand. WILLARD (V.O.) It was the strangest thing -- I don't know that I can explain it. Two of my men dead, and all I could think of was whether Kurtz was dead too. That's all I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear Kurtz. He starts to wipe the blood off the boot. WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) Somehow, in the middle of this ... carnival, Kurtz had grown into something -- a gifted officer; a great man. Somehow, he was the only light in this hopeless, hopeless darkness. And now I was too late -- he was probably gone, disappeared... by a grenade rolled into his tent -- or by some spear on the head. Christ, I felt like howling like those animals in the fog. 212 EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat. Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on the edge of the party. WILLARD (V.O.) Here they are in Los Angeles. Everything is safe. There's a supermarket around the corner, the police station around the other. It would seem ridiculous to them that I was shot to hell because I had lost the privilege of listening to the mysterious Colonel Kurtz. (pause) Of course I was wrong. He was waiting for me. Kurtz was alive and he was waiting for me. DISSOLVE TO : 213 EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons. 214 WHAT THEY SEE Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity about them, men and boys, standing passively watching the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red, white and blue. 215 VIEW ON THE P.B.R. The men of the crew are not the same men who began this voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance. The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth. Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the difficult journey. They start to move to their gun positions. WILLARD Just stand here with me where they can see us. Do nothing. 216 VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R. MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly without weapons. The natives standing across the river make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi- tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little boat to penetrate. 217 VIEW ON WILLARD Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass. 218 FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief. 219 VIEW ON WILLARD, THE CREW They look up toward the bank. 220 THEIR POV The temple at NU MUNG BA, a fortified encampment, built around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization. Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze around the fortress. 221 VIEW ON WILLARD He picks up his field glasses and looks through. 222 WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH GLASSES A sign entangled in the barbed wire -- its lettering strict and military: FOURTH SPECIAL FORCES MISSION F-82 NU MUNG BA The GLASSES POV MOVES REVEALING another sign written in a wild psychedelic hand. OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE NOW ! The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat. He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE OFF of him. 223 VIEW ON WILLARD not believing what he's just seen. 224 THE GLASSES POV Once again the young black man is now waving his Australian hat. 225 VIEW ON THE P.B.R. Willard shouts out to the starnge greeter. WILLARD We've been attacked. AUSTRALIAN (shouting back) I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right. Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding them safely in. A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub- merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the ground. Chef nods at the bodies. CHEF Charlie? WILLARD Looks that way. CHEF (looking at the Australian) Who's he? WILLARD God knows. The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat- tered with mud and blood. WILLARD (continuing) Who the hell are you? AUSTRALIAN Moonby. Got any Winstons? WILLARD Moonby what? AUSTRALIAN Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted. WILLARD (incredulously, indicating the hundreds of natives) What is this? MOONBY Oh, they're simple enough people. It's good to see you, baby. Nobody has any Winstons? Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston. MOONBY This boat's a mess. WILLARD Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him. MOONBY Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz. (he puffs, then smiles) You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy. WILLARD Why did they attack us? MOONBY Simple. They don't want him to go. WILLARD You're Australian? MOONBY Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'. WILLARD (almost to himself) So Kurtz is alive. MOONBY Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind. He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his mind's expansion. MOONBY (continuing) But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.' WILLARD Why didn't he shoot you? MOONBY I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too. CHEF Love? MOONBY Oh, no, not what you think... Cosmic love. He made me see things -- things, you know. The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress. 226 WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES Men in small groups, huddled over food. Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible shrunken heads. 227 BACK TO SCENE WILLARD Sounds like he's gone crazy. MOONBY No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy. WILLARD Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads. MOONBY Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels... WILLARD (to his men) We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance. LANCE What? WILLARD Bring your rifles, that's all. (looking at Moonby) Take us to him. MOONBY Right on -- he's been waiting for -- WILLARD And shut up. Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard and the men follow. 228 MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear where a moment before there was only jungle. They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is, if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort, where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more primitive and more savage than any since the time of Captain Cook. They encounter, in the center of the group, what once appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt, wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke, strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47 decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches this beast, who seems shy and retiring. WILLARD Who are you? MOONBY (breaking in) His name is... WILLARD I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again. Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they are to see him. MAN Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team... Special Forces. F-82 -- Col. Walter Kurtz, commanding. WILLARD What happened here? COLBY What -- happened here. WILLARD Charlie? COLBY NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault. Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what to say to this man, but he understands the forces that pounded him. He takes his arm. 229 REVERSE ON COLBY looks at Willard, not understanding. 230 REVERSE ON WILLARD Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical. WILLARD I'm taking you back. Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand. MOONBY Oh, no, don´t say that. COLBY Take us back. Take us back ! But, the operation -- the team. Colonel Kurtz has such plans for -- the team. WILLARD Take me to him, Major. Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard: COLBY I had nothing to do with these operations -- I did not do the planning -- none of us did. It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he was the genius. You'll see -- the genius of our Colonel. He should be made a General, don't you think? A General? It's... Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns. Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together, though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish, with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what seems to be a serious wound. 232 VIEW ON WILLARD This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then, automatically, he comes to an attention. WILLARD Colonel Kurtz, I guess. KURTZ I'm Kurtz. WILLARD (he salutes) Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir. 233 VIEW ON KURTZ looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute, and simply: KURTZ At ease... (pause, as he regards him) Sit down. 234 MED. VIEW There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair. But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well. Then Kurtz does. Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from man to man, ritualistically. KURTZ (slowly) Why did you come to ... my province. WILLARD We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help. KURTZ You were not coming here, to see me? WILLARD (finding it more and more difficult to go on with this lie) No -- no, sir. KURTZ You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did. (pause) You are the final justice, aren't you? WILLARD What do you mean, Colonel? KURTZ (gently) What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things? WILLARD You know you're right. There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man. KURTZ Then the Agency approached you. Maybe in a bar in Quinon or Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay for one life. Perhaps a village elder, or a tax collector. Nobody's orders but your own. Exciting work. 235 CLOSE ON WILLARD He remains silent. 236 CLOSE ON KURTZ He smiles. KURTZ You've spent tome at the Royal Tracking School of Malaysia. I can tell from the way the laces on your boots are tied. I understand you, Captain. We understand each other. There is a long pause, as the two men regard each other. Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin. WILLARD Do you know me? KURTZ Yes. Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another word or gesture, shoots and kills a man. KURTZ (continuing) Do you know me ? He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful distance behind. Even Willard is stunned. CHEF Holy shit. 237 EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like a primitive civilization. 238 VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall next to him. He is exhausted. Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef approaches, crouches down. CHEF Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time. WILLARD I know. Lance stirs; starts to wake up. CHEF What are we doing here? WILLARD Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said. KURTZ Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts -- WILLARD Yeah. CHEF He killed that guy without feeling anything. WILLARD Not a thing. CHEF When you kill Cong, don't you feel something. WILLARD Sure. (thinking) Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle. Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened. 239 FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar emplacement. Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow to Willard as he passes. WILLARD This is good -- triple overlapping fields of fire -- walls so thick ordinary artillery just cleans the moss off their surfaces. A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then runs off to her bunker. WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on a big piece of almost raw meat. WILLARD (continuing) I've done things, when I was alone in the jungle -- that I never told anyone about. They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of fire into the jungle beyond. Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with bayonets. CHEF This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here. WILLARD Yeah, I know. CHEF I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America ! WILLARD (lost in his thoughts) ... he's an amazing officer. CHEF You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don'´t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick. Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of nods, sucking a joint. WILLARD Yeah. I know. He thinks. 240 INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting. 241 WILLARD'S VIEW An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head- quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards, but have now fallen into decayed disuse. There are other indications of the modern headquarters this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor- tant. Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair. There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche "Nothing is true -- everything is permitted." Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to Willard. MOONBY He's asleep -- don't bother him. KURTZ I'm awake. Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby. KURTZ (continuing) You. Get out. Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with Willard. KURTZ (continuing; suddenly) I said get the fuck out ! (to himself) I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow. (he shows some pain when moving his midsection) He´s only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic. WILLARD You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars. KURTZ That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...' Willard shrugs. KURTZ (continuing) Do you? WILLARD Yeah, I like it... KURTZ I love it. He rests back, grinning. WILLARD You've gone crazy. KURTZ (angrily) No. My thinking is clear. (calmly) But my soul has gone mad. Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor. KURTZ (continuing) My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut ! Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the wound. 242 EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in, witnessing the proceedings inside. CHEF (muttering) Kill him -- come on, why don't you kill him 243 INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD - NIGHT Willard examining the wound. KURTZ (in pain) Oh shit -- on the table; morphine. Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing Kurtz and injects him with the drug. KURTZ (continuing; looking up in pain) You see how stupid it would have been to blow out my brains? I'm dying from the gut anyway. Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly frightened, holds up his hand. KURTZ (continuing) No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water. WILLARD You can't have water after morphine. KURTZ Still playing by the rules. (almost affectionately) You're a damn good kiler. WILLARD (still holding the second morphine) How's the pain? KURTZ How's yours? WILLARD I can handle it. KURTZ Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle. WILLARD What Truth? KURTZ The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why? (looks at him) Yes, you know why. (he looks) Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here. (coldly) Except me. He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect. KURTZ (continuing) Gimme water. WILLARD No water. KURTZ You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans ! He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches him impassively. KURTZ (continuing) This water's got Moonby's acid in it -- He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard. KURTZ (continuing) Drink it -- drink it for tonight. Think of it. A whole regiment of those shitty little Cong -- War. Total war -- war like you've never known it. It's beautiful -- you'll love it. Trust me. 244 EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out. CHEF Lance -- the fucker's not gonna do it. KURTZ Goddamn -- You've gotta dig napalm on Speed, too. It's spectacular, you'll see. Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern with Chef. 245 INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his hand. KURTZ Look into the jungle. You can't -- it's too terrible. You have to smear yourself with warpaint to look at it -- you have to be a cannibal. (whispered) That's why warpaint was invented. Then it becomes your jungle. Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine. WILLARD How did we get here? KURTZ Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie. WILLARD I think think a lie stinks. KURTZ Oh Captain, that is so true. WILLARD Stinks. I could never figure -- (he drinks from the canteen) I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes. Willard drinks more of the LSD water. KURTZ (angrily) You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense. WILLARD Fuck no. KURTZ I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want. WILLARD We'll exterminate the fuckers ! Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified. He draws his bayonet. CHEF Captain -- kill him. KURTZ Think of it -- for years, millions of years, savages with pathetic painted faces were scared shitless that fire would rain down from the sky. And goddamn, we made it happen. God bless Dow ! CHEF Kill him ! Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively, Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets. 246 VIEW ON LANCE He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort of mindless, programmed killer. LANCE (FIRING) Hot damn ! Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an instant of silence, then: 247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming, as illuminating flares light up the blackness. 248 MED. CLOSE VIEW of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted out to the enemy, poised to attack. 249 ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay- onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish in water pipes. One looks up to the sky. 250 EIS VIEW A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche- delic hallucination. 251 VIEW ON THE SOLDIER SOLDIER Wow... Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t himself. 252 MED. VIEW ON THE GATE Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior -- Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans, even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow, salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and purple. We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of teeth around his neck, his face painted. 253 FULL VIEW - MONTAGE Enemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress. 254 CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR A hand drops a shell and it FIRES. 255 CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some sort of cosmic flower. 256 CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK) Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy. 257 SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS blasting out music. 258 MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS With the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to radios in their cars. 259 SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS (In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock and flame fly and it is beautiful to see. Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope. 260 WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach- ing the outer perimeters. Thousands of them. 261 FULL SHOT ON KURTZ KURTZ Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant. Mini-gun. 262 MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS BURST around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as 7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser- geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell. 263 VIEW ON WILLARD Exhilarated, and moving with the MUSIC. WILLARD Napalm. Colby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il- luminated by napalm drums, phosphorescent napalm EXPLODES beautiful, like a magnificent firework. 264 VIEW ON KURTZ KURTZ Claymores, claymores. The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another. Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv- ing in front of us. The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene- trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight. Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter. 265 FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up. Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol- ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE. 266 FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming. Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands, blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats, biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most horrible savagery. 267 MED. SHOT - WILLARD standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him; he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and BLASTS more as they come. 268 MED. SHOT - LANCE The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over. Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times. He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls under the enemy's feet. 269 VIEW ON MOONBY sees this and scampers off into the jungle, muttering madly to himself. 270 MED. VIEW - WILLARD AT THE R.T. shouting into the radio WILLARD Code -- Street Gang -- Street Gang ! Purgative air strike; Street Gang ! He turns and runs back through the compound with the receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere. The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches through metal. 271 FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch- es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE. The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker. 272 VIEW ON WILLARD watching this spectacle. 273 MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ He rounds the shadow wall. Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun at his side and steps out. KURTZ (yelling) Charles ! They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club. 274 MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett at the Alamo. 275 FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything. It is the biggest firework show in history. The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it. Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color. 276 TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the crawling Kurtz KURTZ Go away -- hide yourself. WILLARD What are you doing? KURTZ Going back - to the jungle to die. WILLARD I'm taking you back. You can still live. KURTZ I had immense plans. WILLARD I'm gonna get you out of here. KURTZ I was on threshold of great things. Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck, holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The spectacle continues in the b.g. 277 EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages to get him onto the boat. 278 EXTREME FULL SHOT The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of Nu Mung Ba. FADE OUT. FADE IN. 279 EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and some Montagnards sit near them. Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something. Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the f.g. below is Lance, dead. Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair. COLBY Who is he? WILLARD He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war. CUT TO: 280 THE P.B.R. battered, moving slowly down the river. 281 TIGHTER VIEW Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious. Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks. Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air. Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him. The battle is not over. KURTZ Don't. Don't frighten them away. Willard looks down at him. WILLARD So you understand this? Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his eyes. There is a slight smile. KURTZ Do I not? 282 EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river. KURTZ My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife... (he looks at Willard) ... my death. WILLARD You had immense plans... immense plans... KURTZ Yes... WILLARD I'm taking you back. Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry that is no more than a breath. KURTZ The horror, the horror. We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching. The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up, craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points. COLBY There. Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC helicopters hooping toward them. COLBY (continuing) How did they know? WILLARD They must have seen the fire. The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US. COLBY They're coming to rescue us. They're Medevac. 283 CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD He stares up at the sky. WILLARD (to himself) They're coming to take us back. Copters directly overhead. WILLARD (continuing) Yeah. COLBY Colonel Kurtz, he's dead. WILLARD Yeah. He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap- proaching rescue helicopter. 284 FULL SHOT - THE COPTER It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the sky. 285 FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY WILLARD Yeah. Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at the retreating American helicopters. 286 HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller. WILLARD (V.O.) ... Don't remember a lot about my rehabilitation... but I was sent back to the world before the fall of Saigon... 287 EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina. Pause. Willard is very silent. WILLARD I never answered questions about Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his unimportant papers -- but for the most part I saved everything. There were other letters, personal ones written earlier to his wife. I brought them to het. I watched the fall of Saigon on television in a bar in Alameda... 289 EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh- borhood. Some kids are playing in the street. Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy looks back. WILLARD Hi. Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a sense of purity about her, though she is not young. KURTZ'S WIFE Come in, Captain Willard. He enters. 289 INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY Everything good and secure and desirable about America. She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous. KURTZ'S WIFE Can I get anything for you? There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is there in the various stages of his career. Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her. KURTZ'S WIFE (continuing) Did you know him very well? WILLARD You get to know each other pretty well out there. KURTZ'S WIFE And you admired him? WILLARD He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to -- KURTZ'S WIFE Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best. WILLARD You knew him best. KURTZ'S WIFE You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this... (the packet) If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was -- WILLARD Yes, I know... KURTZ'S WIFE I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him... WILLARD Both of us... KURTZ'S WIFE Men looked up to him... (she loses herself in a thought) He died as he lived... WILLARD His death was -- yes, he died as he lived. KURTZ'S WIFE Were you with him, when... WILLARD Yes I was... He said his last words to me. Pause. 290 MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what she will ask. KURTZ'S WIFE What were they? 291 MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE KURTZ'S WIFE Tell me. 292 MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD remembering that incredible day moving down the river. Our VIEW LOOSENS KURTZ'S WIFE Tell me what he said. KURTZ (V.O.) The horror ! The horror ! WILLARD He spoke of you, ma'am. He sits there looking at her. 293 EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of the few guests left. We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to Willard. DISSOLVE TO: 294 EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust- ed, half-dead Colby. And HOLDING Kurtz, Willard. We HEAR THE DOORS' "THE END" as we present the END TITLES.

"SCHINDLER'S LIST" BY Steven Zaillian Final Draft IN BLACK AND WHITE: TRAIN WHEELS grinding against track, slowing. FOLDING TABLE LEGS scissoring open. The LEVER of a train door being pulled. NAMES on lists on clipboards held by clerks moving alongside the tracks. CLERKS (V.O.) ...Rossen... Lieberman... Wachsberg... BEWILDERED RURAL FACES coming down off the passenger train. FORMS being set out on the folding tables. HANDS straightening pens and pencils and ink pads and stamps. CLERKS (V.O.) ...When your name is called go over there... take this over to that table... TYPEWRITER KEYS rapping a name onto a list. A FACE. KEYS typing another name. Another FACE. CLERKS (V.O.) ...you’re in the wrong line, wait over there... you, come over here... A MAN is taken from one long line and led to the back of another. A HAND hammers a rubber stamp at a form. Tight on a FACE. KEYS type another NAME. Another FACE. Another NAME. CLERKS (V.O.) ...Biberman... Steinberg... Chilowitz... As a hand comes down stamping a GRAY STRIPE across a registration card, there is absolute silence... then MUSIC, the Hungarian love song, "Gloomy Sunday," distant... and the stripe bleeds into COLOR, into BRIGHT YELLOW INK. INT. HOTEL ROOM - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT The song plays from a radio on a rust-stained sink. The light in the room is dismal, the furniture cheap. The curtains are faded, the wallpaper peeling... but the clothes laid out across the single bed are beautiful. The hands of a man button the shirt, belt the slacks. He slips into the double-breasted jacket, knots the silk tie, folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket, all with great deliberation. A bureau. Some currency, cigarettes, liquor, passport. And an elaborate gold-on-black enamel Hakenkreuz (or swastika) which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner jacket. He steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror. He likes what he sees: Oskar Schindler -- salesman from Zwittau -- looking almost reputable in his one nice suit. Even in this awful room. INT. NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT A spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke-choked club to a small stage where a cabaret performer sings. It’s September, 1939. General Sigmund List's armored divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, have taken Cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, conducting business, is a strange clientele: SS officers and Polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown together by the circumstance of war. Oskar Schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the faces, stripping away all that’s unimportant to him, settling only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand. WAITER SETS DOWN DRINKS in front of the SS officer who took the money. A lieutenant, he’s at a table with his girlfriend and a lower-ranking officer. WAITER From the gentleman. The waiter is gesturing to a table across the room where Schindler, seemingly unaware of the SS men, drinks with the best-looking woman in the place. LIEUTENANT Do I know him? His sergeant doesn’t. His girlfriend doesn't. LIEUTENANT Find out who he is. The sergeant makes his way over to Schindler's table. There's a handshake and introductions before -- and the lieutenant, watching, can't believe it -- his guy accepts the chair Schindler's dragging over. The lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's forgotten already he went there for a reason. Finally, and it irritates the SS man, he has to get up and go over there. LIEUTENANT Stay here. His girlfriend watches him cross toward Schindler's table. Before he even arrives, Schindler is up and berating him for leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide some tables together. WAITERS ARRIVE WITH PLATES OF CAVIAR and another round of drinks. The lieutenant makes a halfhearted move for his wallet. LIEUTENANT Let me get this one. SCHINDLER No, put it away, put it away. Schindler's already got his money out. Even as he's paying, his eyes are working the room, settling on a table where a girl is declining the advances of two more high-ranking SS men. A TABLECLOTH BILLOWS as a waiter lays it down on another table that's been added to the others. Schindler seats the SS officers on either side of his own "date" -- SCHINDLER What are you drinking, gin? He motions to a waiter to refill the men's drinks, and, returning to the head of the table(s), sweeps the room again with his eyes. ROAR OF LAUGHTER erupts from Schindler's party in the corner. Nobody's having a better time than those people over there. His guests have swelled to ten or twelve -- SS men, Polish cops, girls -- and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is, making sure everybody's got enough to eat and drink. Here, closer, at this table across the room, an SS officer gestures to one of the SS men who an hour ago couldn't get the girl to sit at his table. The guy comes over. SS OFFICER 1 Who is that? SS OFFICER 2 (like everyone knows) That's Oskar Schindler. He's an old friend of... I don't know, somebody's. GIRL WITH A BIG CAMERA screws in a flashbulb. She lifts the unwieldy thing to her face and focuses. As the bulb flashes, the noise of the club suddenly drops out, and the moment is caught in BLACK and WHITE: Oskar Schindler, surrounded by his many new friends, smiling urbanely. EXT. SQUARE - CRACOW - DAY A photograph of a face on a work card, BLACK and WHITE. A typed name, black and white. A hand affixes a sticker to the card and it saturates with COLOR, DEEP BLUE. People in long lines, waiting. Others near idling trucks, waiting. Others against sides of buildings, waiting. Clerks with clipboards move through the crowds, calling out names. CLERKS Groder... Gemeinerowa... Libeskind... INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CRACOW - DAY The party pin in his lapel catches the light in the hallway. SCHINDLER Stern? Behind Schindler, the door to another apartment closes softly. A radio, somewhere, is suddenly silenced. SCHINDLER Are you Itzhak Stern? At the door of this apartment, a man with the face and manner of a Talmudic scholar, finally nods in resignation, like his number has just come up. STERN I am. Schindler offers a hand. Confused, Stern tentatively reaches for it, and finds his own grasped firmly. INT. STERN'S APARTMENT - DAY Settled into an overstuffed chair in a simple apartment, Schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask. SCHINDLER There's a company you did the books for on Lipowa Street, made what, pots and pans? Stern stares at the cognac Schindler's offering him. He doesn't know who this man is, or what he wants. STERN (pause) By law, I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew. Schindler looks puzzled, then shrugs, dismissing it. SCHINDLER All right, you've done it -- good company, you think? He keeps holding out the drink. Stern declines it with a slow shake of his head. STERN It did all right. Schindler nods, takes out a cigarette case. SCHINDLER I don't know anything about enamelware, do you? He offers Stern a cigarette. Stern declines again. STERN I was just the accountant. SCHINDLER Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think? Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you? Schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly be someone else listening in somewhere. SCHINDLER Field kits, mess kits... He waits for a reaction, and misinterprets Stern's silence for a lack of understanding. SCHINDLER Army contracts. But Stern does understand. He understands too well. Schindler grins good-naturedly. SCHINDLER Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think? STERN (with an edge) I think most people right now have other priorities. Schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could possibly be. He can't. SCHINDLER Like what? Stern smiles despite himself. The man's manner is so simple, so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a Jew in occupied Cracow in 1939. He really doesn't know. Stern decides to end the conversation. STERN Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well. In fact the worse things get the better you'll do. It was a "pleasure." SCHINDLER The contracts? That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard. He laughs loudly, uproariously. But then, just as abruptly as the laugh erupted, he's dead serious, all kidding aside -- SCHINDLER You know anybody? Stern stares at him curiously, sitting there taking another sip of his cognac, placid as a large dog. SCHINDLER Jews, yeah. Investors. STERN (pause) Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale. SCHINDLER Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product. They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy. He shrugs; it sounds more than fair to him. But not to Stern. STERN Pots and pans. SCHINDLER (nodding) Something they can hold in their hands. Stern studies him. This man is nothing more than a salesman with a salesman's pitch; just dressed better than most. STERN I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that. SCHINDLER (a slow knowing nod) They should be. Silence. EXT. CRACOW - NIGHT A mason trowels mortar onto a brick. As he taps it into a place and scrapes off the excess cement, the image DRAINS OF COLOR. Under lights, a crew of brick-layers is erecting a ten-foot wall where a street once ran unimpeded. EXT. STREET - CRACOW - DAY A young man emerges from an alley pocketing his Jewish armband. He crosses a street past German soldiers and trucks and climbs the steps of St. Mary's cathedral. INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY A dark and cavernous place. A priest performing Mass to scattered parishioners. Lots of empty pews. The young Polish Jew from the street, Poldek Pfefferberg, kneels, crosses himself, and slides in next to another young man, Goldberg, going over notes scribbled on a little pad inside a missal. Pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe polish he takes from his pocket. Whispered, bored -- GOLDBERG What's that? PFEFFERBERG You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for. GOLDBERG You asked for shoe polish. PFEFFERBERG My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army. But by the time it got there -- because of the cold -- it broke, the whole truckload. GOLDBERG (pause) So I'm responsible for the weather? PFEFFERBERG I asked for metal, you gave me glass. GOLDBERG This is not my problem. PFEFFERBERG Look it up. Goldberg doesn't bother; he pockets his little notepad and intones a response to the priest's prayer, all but ignoring Pfefferberg. PFEFFERBERG This is not your problem? Everybody wants to know who I got it from, and I'm going to tell them. Goldberg glances to Pfefferberg for the first time, and, greatly put upon, takes out his little notepad again and makes a notation in it. GOLDBERG Metal. He flips the pad closed, pockets it, crosses himself as he gets up, and leaves. INT. HOTEL - DAY Pfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another black market middleman, the desk clerk. Both are wearing their armbands. Pfefferberg underlines figures on a little notepad of his own -- PFEFFERBERG Let's say this is what you give me. These are fees I have to pay some guys. This is my commission. This is what I bring you back in Occupation currency. The clerk, satisfied with the figures, is about to hand over to Pfefferberg some outlawed Polish notes from an envelope when Schindler comes in from the street. The clerk puts the money away, gets Schindler his room key, waits for him to leave so he can finish his business with Pfefferberg... but Schindler doesn't leave; he just keeps looking over at Pfefferberg's shirt, at the cuffs, the collar. PFEFFERBERG That's a nice shirt. Pfefferberg nods, Yeah, thanks, and waits for Schindler to leave; but he doesn't. Nor does he appear to hear the short burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the street. SCHINDLER You don't know where I could find a shirt like that. Pfefferberg knows he should say 'no,' let that be the end of it. It's not wise doing business with a German who could have you arrested for no reason whatsoever. But there's something guileless about it. PFEFFERBERG Like this? SCHINDLER (nodding) There's nothing in the stores. The clerk tries to discourage Pfefferberg from pursuing this transaction with just a look. Pfefferberg ignores it. PFEFFERBERG You have any idea what a shirt like this costs? SCHINDLER Nice things cost money. The clerk tries to tell Pfefferberg again with a look that this isn't smart. PFEFFERBERG How many? SCHINDLER I don't know, ten or twelve. That's a good color. Dark blues, grays. Schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills, waiting for Pfefferberg to nod when it's enough. He's being overcharged, and he knows it, but Pfefferberg keeps pushing it, more. The look Schindler gives him lets him know that he's trying to hustle a hustler, but that, in this instance at least, he'll let it go. He hands over the money and Pfefferberg hands over his notepad. PFEFFERBERG Write down your measurements. As he writes down the information, Pfefferberg glances to the desk clerk and offers a shrug. As he writes -- SCHINDLER I'm going to need some other things. As things come up. EXT. GARDEN - SCHERNER'S RESIDENCE - CRACOW - DAY As Oberfuhrer Scherner and his daughter, in a wedding gown, dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand, the reception guests drink and eat at tables set up on an expansive lawn. CZURDA The SS doesn't own the trains, somebody's got to pay. Whether it's a passenger car or a livestock car, it doesn't matter -- which, by the way, you have to see. You have to set aside an afternoon, go down to the station and see this. Other SS and Army officers share the table with Czurda. Schindler, too, nice blue shirt, jacket, only he doesn't seem to be paying attention; rather his attention and affections are directed to the blonde next to him, Ingrid. CZURDA So you got thousands of fares that have to be paid. Since it's the SS that's reserved the trains, logically they should pay. But this is a lot of money. (pause) The Jews. They're the ones riding the trains, they should pay. So you got Jews paying their own fares to ride on cattle cars to God knows where. They pay the SS full fare, the SS turns around, pays the railroad a reduced excursion fare, and pockets the difference. He shrugs, There you have it. Brilliant. He glances off, sees something odd across the yard. Two horses, saddled-up, being led into the garden by a stable boy. SCHINDLER (to Ingrid) Excuse me. Schindler gets up from the table. Scherner, his wife and daughter and son-in-law stare at the horses; they're beautiful. Schindler appears, takes the reins from the stable boy, hands one set to the bride and the other to the groom. SCHINDLER There's nothing more sacred than marriage. No happier an occasion than one's wedding day. I wish you all the best. Scherner hails a photographer. As the guy comes over with his camera, so does just about everybody else. Scherner insists Schindler pose with the astonished bride and groom. Big smiles. Flash. INT. STOREFRONT - CRACOW - DAY A neighborhood place. Bread, pastries, couple of tables. At one sits owner and a well-dressed man in his seventies, Max Redlicht. OWNER I go to the bank, I go in, they tell me my account's been placed in Trust. In Trust? What are they talking about, whose Trust? The Germans'. I look around. Now I see that everybody's arguing, they can't get to their money either. MAX REDLICHT This is true? OWNER I'll take you there. Max looks at the man not without sympathy. He's never heard of such a thing. It's really a bad deal. But then -- MAX REDLICHT Let me understand. The Nazis have taken your money. So because they've done this to you, you expect me to go unpaid. That's what you're saying. The owner of the place just stares at Redlicht. MAX REDLICHT That makes sense to you? The man doesn't answer. He watches Max get up and cross to the front door where he says something to two of his guys and leaves. The guys come in and start carting out anything of any value: cash register, a chair, a loaf of bread... EXT. CRACOW STREET - DAY Max strolls along the sidewalk, browsing in store windows. People inside and out nod hello, but they despise him, they fear him. Just as he's passing a synagogue, some men in long overcoats cross the street. Einsatzgruppen, they are an elite and wild bunch, one of six Special Chivalrous Duty squads assigned to Cracow. INT. STARAR BOZNICA SYNAGOGUE - SAME TIME - DAY The Sabbath prayers of a congregation of Orthodox Jews are interrupted by a commotion at the rear of the ancient temple. Several non-Orthodox Jews from the street, including Max Redlicht, are being herded inside by the Einsatz Boys. They're made to stand before the Ark in two lines: Orthodox and non. One of the Einsatzgruppen squad removes the parchment Torah scroll while another calmly addresses the assembly: EINSATZ NCO I want you to spit on it. I want you to walk past, spit on it, and stand over there. No one does anything for a moment. The liberals from the street seem to say with their eyes, Come on, we're all too sophisticated for this; the others, with the beards and sidelocks, silently check with their rabbi. One by one then they file past and spit on the scroll. The last two, the rabbi and Max Redlicht hesitate. They exchange a glance. The rabbi finally does it; the gangster doesn't. After a long tense silence. MAX REDLICHT I haven't been to temple must be fifty years. (to the rabbi) Nor have I been invited. The Einsatz NCO glances from Max to the rabbi and smiles to himself. This is unexpected, this rift. MAX REDLICHT (to the rabbi) You don't approve of the way I make my living? I'm a bad man, I do bad things? Max admits it with a shrug. MAX REDLICHT I've done some things... but I won't do this. Silence. The Einsatz NCO glances away to the others, amused. EINSATZ NCO What does this mean? Of all of you, there's only one who has the guts to say no? One? And he doesn't even believe? (no one, of course answer him) I come in here, I ask you to do something no one should ever ask. And you do it? (pause) What won't you do? Nobody answers. He turns to Max. EINSATZ NCO You, sir, I respect. He pulls out a revolver and shoots the old gangster in the head. He's dead before he hits the floor. EINSATZ NCO The rest of you... ...are beneath his contempt. He turns and walks away. The other Einsatz Boys pull rifles and revolvers from their coats and open fire. EXT. CRACOW - DAY In BLACK AND WHITE and absolute silence, a suitcase thrown from a second story window arcs slowly through the air. As it hits the pavement, spilling open -- SOUND ON -- and, returning to COLOR -- Thousands of families pushing barrows through the streets of Kazimierz, dragging mattresses over the bridge at Podgorze, carrying kettles and fur coats and children on a mass forced exodus into the ghetto. Crowds of Poles line the sidewalks like spectators on a parade route. Some wave. Some take it more soberly, as if sensing they may be next. POLISH GIRL Goodbye, Jews. EXT. GHETTO GATE - DAY The little folding tables have been dragged out and set up again, and at them sit the clerks. Goldberg, of all people, has somehow managed to elevate himself to a station of some authority. Armed with something more frightening than a gun -- a clipboard -- he abets the Gestapo in their task of deciding who passes through the ghetto gate and who detours to the train station. PFEFFERBERG What's this? Pfefferberg, with his wife Mila, at the head of a line that seems to stretch back forever, flicks at Goldberg's OD armband with disgust. GOLDBERG Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it? PFEFFERBERG Yeah, I can. They consider each other for a long moment before Pfefferberg leads his wife past Goldberg and into the ghetto. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, GHETTO - NIGHT Dismayed by each others' close proximity, Orthodox and liberal Jews wait to use the floor's single bathroom. INT. GHETTO APARTMENT - NIGHT From the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor. In this apartment, looking like they can't bear much more of it, sit some non-Orthodox businessmen, Stern and Schindler. SCHINDLER For each thousand you invest, you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month -- to begin in July and to continue for one year -- after which time, we're even. (he shrugs) That's it. He lets them think about it, pours a shot of cognac from his flask, offers it to Stern, who brought this group together and now sits at Schindler's side. The accountant declines. INVESTOR 1 Not good enough. SCHINDLER Not good enough? Look where you're living. Look where you've been put. "Not good enough." (he almost laughs at the squalor) A couple of months ago, you'd be right. Not anymore. INVESTOR 1 Money's still money. SCHINDLER No, it isn't, that's why we're here. Schindler lights a cigarette and waits for their answer. It doesn't come. Just a silence. Which irritates him. SCHINDLER Did I call this meeting? You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me. I'm here. Now you want to negotiate? The offer's withdrawn. He caps his flask, pockets it, reaches for his top coat. INVESTOR 2 How do we know you'll do what you say? SCHINDLER Because I said I would. What do you want, a contract? To be filed where? (he slips into his coat) I said what I'll do, that's our contract. The investors study him. This is not a manageable German. Whether he's honest or not is impossible to say. Their glances to Stern don't help them; he doesn't know either. The silence in the room is filled by the muffled singing next door. One of the men eventually nods, He's in. Then another. And another. INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY A red power button is pushed, starting the motor of a huge metal press. The machine whirs, louder, louder. INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY Schindler, at a wall of a windows, is peering down at the lone technician making adjustments to the machine. STERN The standard SS rate for Jewish skilled labor is seven Marks a day, five for unskilled and women. This is what you pay the Economic Office, the laborers themselves receive nothing. Poles you pay wages. Generally, they get a little more. Are you listening? Schindler turns from the wall of glass to face his new accountant. SCHINDLER What was that about the SS, the rate, the... ? STERN The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing. SCHINDLER But it's less. It's less than what I would pay a Pole. That's the point I'm trying to make. Poles cost more. Stern hesitates, then nods. The look on Schindler's face says, Well, what's to debate, the answer's clear to any fool. SCHINDLER Why should I hire Poles? INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY Another machine starting up, growling louder, louder -- EXT. PEACE SQUARE, THE GHETTO - DAY To a yellow identity card with a sepia photograph a German clerk attaches a blue sticker, the holy Blauschein, proof that the carrier is an essential worker. At other folding tables other clerks pass summary judgment on hundreds of ghetto dwellers standing in long lines. TEACHER I'm a teacher. The man tries to hand over documentation supporting the claim along with his Kennkarte to a German clerk. CLERK Not essential work, stand over there. Over there, other "non-essential people" are climbing onto trucks bound for unknown destinations. The teacher reluctantly relinquishes his place in line. EXT. PEACE SQUARE - LATER - DAY The teacher at the head of the line again, but this time with Stern at his side. TEACHER I'm a metal polisher. He hands over a piece of paper. The clerk takes a look, is satisfied with it, brushes glue on the back of a Blauschein and sticks it to the man's work card. CLERK Good. The world's gone mad. INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY Another machine starting up, a lathe. A technician points things out to the teacher and some others recruited by Stern. The motor grinds louder, louder. INT. APARTMENT - DAY Schindler wanders around a large empty apartment. There's lots of light, glass bricks, modern lines, windows looking out on a park. INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT The same place full of furniture and people. Lots of SS in uniform. Wine. Girls. Schindler, drinking with Oberfuhrer Scherner, keeps glancing across the room to a particularly good-looking Polish girl with another guy in uniform. SCHERNER I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it -- money, favors -- I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -- SCHINDLER No, look. It's the others. They're the ones causing these delays. SCHERNER What others? SCHINDLER Whoever. They're the ones. They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me. Scherner thinks he understands what Schindler's saying. Just in case he doesn't -- SCHINDLER I should send it to you, though, don't you think? You can forward it on? I'd be grateful. Scherner nods. Yes, they understand each other. SCHERNER That'd be fine. SCHINDLER Done. Let's not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time. INT. SS OFFICE - DAY Scherner at his desk initialing several Armaments contracts. The letters D.E.F. appear on all of them. EXT. FACTORY - DAY Men and pulleys hoist a big "F" up the side of the building. Down below, Schindler watches as the letter is set into place -- D.E.F. INT. FACTORY OFFICES - DAY The good-looking Polish girl from the party, Klonowska, is shown to her desk by Stern. It's right outside Schindler's office. This girl has never typed in her life. INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY Flames ignite with a whoosh in one of the huge furnaces. The needle on a gauge slowly climbs. EXT. CRACOW - DAY A garage door slides open revealing a gleaming black Mercedes. Schindler steps past Pfefferberg and, moving around the car, carefully touches its smooth lines. INT. FACTORY - DAY Another machine starts up. Another. Another. EXT. PEACE SQUARE - DAY Stern with a woman at the head of a line. The clerk affixes the all-important blue sticker to her work card. INT. FACTORY DAY - DAY Three hundred Jewish laborers, men and women, work at the long tables, at the presses, the latches, the furnaces, turning out field kitchenware and mess kits. Few glance up from their work at Schindler, the big gold party pin stuck into his lapel, as he moves through the place, his place, his factory, in full operation. He climbs the stairs to the offices where several secretaries process Armaments orders. He gestures to Stern, at a desk covered with ledgers, to join him in his office. INT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY The accountant follows Schindler into the office. SCHINDLER Sit down. Schindler goes to the wall of windows, his favorite place in the world, and looks down at all the activity below. He pours two drinks from a decanter and, turning back, holds one out to Stern. Stern, of course, declines. Schinder groans. SCHINDLER Oh, come on. He comes over and puts the drink in Stern's hand, moves behind his desk and sits. SCHINDLER My father was fond of saying you need three things in life. A good doctor, a forgiving priest and a clever accountant. The first two... He dismisses them with a shrug; he's never had much use for either. But the third -- he raises his glass to the accountant. Stern's glass stays in his lap. SCHINDLER (long sufferingly) Just pretend for Christ's sake. Stern slowly raises his glass. SCHINDLER Thank you. Schindler drinks; Stern doesn't. INT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - MORNING Klonowska, wearing a man's silk robe, traipses past the remains of a party to the front door. Opening it reveals a nice looking, nicely dressed woman. KLONOWSKA Yes? A series of realizations is made by each of them, quickly, silently, ending up with Klonowska looking ill. SCHINDLER (O.S.) Who is it? INT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - MORNING Schindler sets a cup of coffee down in front of his wife. Behind him, through a doorway, Klonowska can be seen hurriedly gathering her things. SCHINDLER She's so embarrassed -- look at her -- Emilie begrudges him a glance to the bedroom, catching the girl just as she looks up -- embarrassed. SCHINDLER You know what, you'd like her. EMILIE Oskar, please -- SCHINDLER What -- EMILIE I don't have to like her just because you do. It doesn't work that way. SCHINDLER You would, though. That's what I'm saying. His face is complete innocence. It's the first thing she fell in love with; and perhaps the thing that keeps her from killing him now. Klonowska emerges from the bedroom thoroughly self-conscious. KLONOWSKA Goodbye. It was a pleasure meeting you. She shakes Emilie's limp hand. Schindler sees her to the door, lets her out and returns to the table, smiling to himself. Emilie's glancing around at the place. EMILIE You've done well here. He nods; he's proud of it. He studies her. SCHINDLER You look great. EXT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT They emerge from the building in formal clothes, both of them looking great. It's wet and slick; the doorman offers Emilie his arm. DOORMAN Careful of the pavement -- SCHINDLER -- Mrs. Schindler. The doorman shoots a glance to Schindler that asks, clearly, Really? Schindler opens the passenger door of the Mercedes for his wife, and the doorman helps her in. INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A nice place. "No Jews or Dogs Allowed." The maitre 'd welcomes the couple warmly, shakes Schindler's hand. Nodding to his date -- SCHINDLER Mrs. Schindler. The maitre 'd tries to bury his surprise. He's almost successful. INT. RESTAURANT - LATER - NIGHT No fewer than four waiters attend them -- refilling a glass, sliding pastries onto china, lighting Schindler's cigarette, raking crumbs from the table with little combs. EMILIE It's not a charade, all this? SCHINDLER A charade? How could it be a charade? She doesn't know, but she does know him. And all these signs of apparent success just don't fit his profile. Schindler lets her in on a discovery. SCHINDLER There's no way I could have known this before, but there was always something missing. In every business I tried, I see now it wasn't me that was failing, it was this thing, this missing thing. Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it, because you can't create this sort of thing. And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure. He waits for her to guess what the thing is. His looks says, It's so simple, how can you not know? EMILIE Luck. SCHINDLER War. INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT "Gloomy Sunday" from a combo on a stage. Schindler and Emilie dancing. Pressed against her -- both have had a few -- he can feel her laugh to herself. SCHINDLER What? EMILIE I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good. He smiles, even as his eyes roam the room and find and meet the eyes of a German girl dancing with another man. INT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT Schindler and Emilie lounging in bed, champagne bottle on the nightstand. Long silence before -- EMILIE Should I stay? SCHINDLER (pause) It's a beautiful city. That's not the answer she's looking for and he knows it. EMILIE Should I stay? SCHINDLER (pause) It's up to you. That's not it either. EMILIE No, it's up to you. Schindler stares out at the lights of the city. They look like jewels. EMILIE Promise me no doorman or maitre 'd will presume I am anyone other than Mrs. Schindler... and I'll stay. He promises her nothing. EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY Emilie waves goodbye to him from a first-class compartment window. Down on the platform, he waves goodbye to her. as the train pulls away, he turns away, and the platform of the next track is revealed -- soldiers and clerks supervising the boarding of hundreds of people onto another train -- the image turning BLACK AND WHITE. CLERKS Your luggage will follow you. Make sure it's clearly labeled. Leave your luggage on the platform. EXT. D.E.F. LOADING DOCK - DAY As workers load crates of enamelware onto trucks -- back to COLOR -- Stern and Schindler and the dock foreman confer over an invoice. More to Stern -- FOREMAN Every other time it's been all right. This time when I weigh the truck, I see he's heavy, he's loaded too much. I point this out to him, I tell him to wait, he tells me he's got a new arrangement with Mr. Schindler -- (to Schindler) -- that you know all about it and it's okay with you. SCHINDLER It's "okay" with me? On the surface, Schindler remains calm; underneath, he's livid. Clearly it's not "okay" with him. STERN How heavy was he? FOREMAN Not that much, just too much for it to be a mistake -- 200 kilos. Stern and Schindler exchange a glance. Then -- SCHINDLER (pause) You're sure. The foreman nods. INT. GHETTO STOREFRONT - DAY Pfefferberg and Schindler bang in through the front door, startling a woman at a desk. WOMAN AT DESK Can I help you? They move past her without a word and into the back of the place, into a storeroom. They stride past long racks full of enamelware and other goods. A man glances up, sees them coming. He's one of Schindler's investors, the one who questioned the German's word. The man's teenage sons rush to their father's defense, but Pfefferberg grabs him and locks an arm tightly around his neck. Silence. Then, calmly -- SCHINDLER If you or anyone acting as an agent for you comes to my factory again, I'll have you arrested. INVESTOR It was a mistake. SCHINDLER It was a mistake? What was a mistake? How do you know what I'm talking about? INVESTOR All right, it wasn't a mistake, but it was one time. SCHINDLER We had a deal, you broke it. One phone call and your whole family is dead. He turns and walks away. Pfefferberg lets the guy go and follows. The investor's sons help their father up off the floor. Gasping, he yells. INVESTOR I gave you money. -- but Schindler and Pfefferberg are already gone, coming through the front office and out the front door -- EXT. STOREFRONT - CONTINUOUS - DAY -- to the street. Pfefferberg looks a little shaken from the experience. Schindler straightens his friend's clothes. SCHINDLER How you feeling, all right? PFEFFERBERG Yeah. SCHINDLER What's the matter, everything all right at home? (Pfefferberg nods) Mila's okay? PFEFFERBERG She's good. Well, then, Schindler can't imagine what could be wrong. He pats Pfefferberg on the shoulder and leads him away. SCHINDLER Good. INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY The long tables accommodate most of workers. The rest eat their lunch on the floor. Soup and bread. INT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY An elegant place setting for one. Meat, vegetables, glass of wine, all untouched. Schindler leafing through pages of a report Stern has prepared for him. SCHINDLER I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot. We're doing well? STERN Yes. SCHINDLER Better this month than last? STERN Yes. SCHINDLER Any reason to think next month will be worse? STERN The war could end. No chance of that. Satisfied, Schindler returns the report to his accountant and starts to eat. Stern knows he is excused, but looks like he wants to say something more; he just doesn't know how to say it. SCHINDLER (impatient) What? STERN (pause) There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job. Schindler gives his accountant a long-suffering look. STERN He asks every day. It'll just take a minute. He's very grateful. Schindler's silence says, Is this really necessary? Stern pretends it's a tacit okay, goes to the door and pokes his head out. STERN Mr. Lowenstein? An old man with one arm appears in the doorway and Schindler glances to the ceiling, to heaven. As the man slowly makes his way into the room, Schindler sees the bruises on his face. And when he speaks, only half his mouth moves; the other half is paralyzed. LOWENSTEIN I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work. SCHINDLER You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job. Schindler shakes the man's hand perfunctorily and tells Stern with a look, okay, that's enough, get him out of here. LOWENSTEIN The SS beat me up. They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you. SCHINDLER That's great. LOWENSTEIN I work hard for you. I'll continue to work hard for you. SCHINDLER That's great, thanks. LOWENSTEIN God bless you, sir. SCHINDLER Yeah, okay. LOWENSTEIN You're a good man. Schindler is dying, and telling Stern with his eyes, Get this guy out of here. Stern takes the man's arm. STERN Okay, Mr. Lowenstein. LOWENSTEIN He saved my life. STERN Yes, he did. LOWENSTEIN God bless him. STERN Yes. They disappear out the door. Schindler sits down to his meal. And tries to eat it. EXT. FACTORY - DAY Stern and Schindler emerge from the rear of the factory. The Mercedes is waiting, the back door held open by a driver. Climbing in -- SCHINDLER Don't ever do that to me again. STERN Do what? Stern knows what he means. And Schindler knows he knows. SCHINDLER Close the door. The driver closes the door. EXT. GHETTO GATE - DAY Snow on the ground and more coming down. A hundred of Schindler's workers marching past the ghetto gate, as is the custom, under armed guard. Turning onto Zablocie Street, they're halted by an SS unit standing around some trucks. EXT. ZABLOCIE STREET - DAY Shovels scraping at snow. The marchers working to clear it from the street. A dialog between one of the guards and an SS officer is interrupted by a shot -- and the face of the one-armed machinist falls into the frame. INT. OFFICE, SS HEADQUARTERS - DAY Herman Toffel, an SS contact of Schindler's who he actually likes, sits behind his desk. TOFFEL It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys. It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow. SCHINDLER I lost a day of production. I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated. TOFFEL File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right. SCHINDLER Would it do any good? TOFFEL No. Schindler knows it's not Toffel's fault, but the whole situation is maddening to him. He shakes his head in disgust. TOFFEL I think you're going to have to put up with a lot of snow shoveling yet. Schindler gets up, shakes Toffel's hand, turns to leave. TOFFEL A one-armed machinist, Oskar? SCHINDLER (right back) He was a metal press operator, quite skilled. Toffel nods, smiles. EXT. FIELD - DAY From a distance, Stern and Schindler slowly walk a wasteland that lies between the rear of DEF and two other factories -- a radiator works and a box plant. Stern's doing all the talking, in his usual quiet but persuasive manner. Every so often, Schindler, glancing from his own factory to the others, nods. INT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - DAY The party pins the two other German businessmen wear are nothing compared to the elaborate thing in Schindler's lapel. He sits at his desk sipping cognac, a large portrait of Hitler hanging prominently on the wall behind him. SCHINDLER Unlike your radiators -- and your boxes -- my products aren't for sale on the open market. This company has only one client, the German Army. And lately I've been having trouble fulfilling my obligations to my client. With your help, I hope the problem can be solved. The problem, simply, is space. Stern, who has been keeping a low profile, hands the gentlemen each a set of documents. SCHINDLER I'd like you to consider a proposal which I think you'll find equitable. I'd like you to think about it and get back to me as soon as -- KUHNPAST Excuse me -- do you really think this is appropriate? The man glances to Stern, and back to Schindler, his look saying, This is wrong, having a Jew present while we discuss business. If Schindler catches his meaning, he doesn't admit it. Kuhnpast almost sighs. KUHNPAST I can appreciate your problem. If I had any space I could lease you, I would. I don't. I'm sorry. HOHNE Me neither, sorry. SCHINDLER I don't want to lease your facilities, I want to buy them. I'm prepared to offer you fair market value. And to let you stay on, if you want, as supervisors. (pause) On salary. There's a long stunned silence. The Germans can't believe it. After the initial shock wears off, Kuhnpast has to laugh. KUHNPAST You've got to be kidding. Nobody is kidding. KUHNPAST (pause) Thanks for the drink. He sets it down, gets up. Hohne gets up. They return the documents to Stern and turn to leave. They aren't quite out the door when Schindler wonders out loud to Stern: SCHINDLER You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; I've never understood that. What's next? STERN Christmas presents. SCHINDLER Ah, yes. The businessmen slow, but don't look back into the room. EXT. SCHERNER'S RESIDENCE - CRACOW - MORNING Pfefferberg wipes a smudge from the hood of an otherwise pristine BMW Cabriolet. As Scherner and his wife emerge from their house in robes, Scherner whispers to himself -- SCHERNER Oskar... EXT. KUHNPAST'S RADIATOR FACTORY - DAY Workers high on the side of the building toss down the letters of the radiator sign as others hoist up a big "D." Under armed guard, others unload a metal press machine from a truck. INT. RADIATOR FACTORY / DEF ANNEX - DAY Technicians make adjustments to presses already in place. Others test the new firing ovens. Kuhnpast is being forcibly removed from the premises. INT. GHETTO EMPLOYMENT OFFICE - DAY Crowded beyond belief, the place is like a post office gone mad. Stern, moving along one of the impossibly crowded lines, pauses to speak with an elderly couple. EXT. PEACE SQUARE - DAY A hand slaps a blue sticker on a work card. Slap, another. And another. And another. INT. D.E.F. FRONT OFFICE - DAY Christmas decorations. Klonowska at her desk, her eyes closed tight. SCHINDLER All right. She opens her eyes and smiles. Schindler is holding a poodle in his arms. She comes around to kiss him. He sets the dog on the desk. Stern, across the room, watches blank-faced. GESTAPO (O.S.) Oskar Schindler? Schindler, Stern and Klonowska turn to the voice. Two Gestapo men have entered unannounced. GESTAPO We have a warrant to take your company's business records with us. And another to take you. Schindler stares at them in disbelief. Stern quietly slips one of the ledgers on his desk into a drawer. SCHINDLER Am I permitted to have my secretary cancel my appointments for the day? He doesn't wait for their approval. He scribbles down some names -- Toffel, Czurda, Reeder, Scherner. Underlining Scherner, he glances to Klonowska. She understands. INT. OFFICE, SS HEADQUARTERS, CRACOW - DAY A humorless middle-level bureaucrat sits behind a desk and D.E.F.'s ledgers and cashbooks. GESTAPO CLERK You live very well. The man slowly shakes his head 'no' to Schindler's offer of a cigarette. Schindler tamps it against the crystal of his gold watch. GESTAPO CLERK This standard of living comes entirely from legitimate sources, I take it? Schindler lights the cigarette and drags on it, all but ignoring the man. GESTAPO CLERK As an SS supplier, you have a moral obligation to desist from blackmarket dealings. You're in business to support the war effort, not to fatten -- SCHINDLER (interrupting) You know? When my friends ask, I'd love to be able to tell them you treated me with the utmost courtesy and respect. The quiet matter-of-fact tone, more than the comment itself, throws the bureaucrat off his rhythm. His eyes narrow slightly. There's a long silence. INT. HALLWAY/ROOM - SS HEADQUARTERS - DAY The two who arrested him lead Schindler down a long hallway. They reach a door, have him step inside and close the door after him. INT. SS "CELL" - EVENING Schindler knocks on the inside of the door. A Waffen SS man opens it. The "prisoner" peels several bills from a thick wad. SCHINDLER Chances of getting a bottle of vodka pretty good? He hands the young guard five times the going price. WAFFEN GUARD Yes, sir. The guard turns to leave. SCHINDLER Wait a minute. He peels off several more bills and hands them over. SCHINDLER Pajamas. INT. SS "CELL" - MORNING Perched on the side of the bed in pajamas, Schindler works on a breakfast of herring and eggs, cheeses, rolls and coffee. Someone has also brought him a newspaper. There's an apologetic knock on the door before it opens. GUARD I'm sorry to disturb you, sir. Whenever you're ready, you're free to leave. INT. FOYER, SS HEADQUARTERS - MORNING Schindler, the Gestapo clerk and one of the arresting officers cross the foyer. GESTAPO CLERK I'd advise you not to get too comfortable. Sooner or later, law prevails. No matter who your friends are. Schindler ignores the man completely. Reaching the front doors, the clerk turns over the D.E.F. records to their owner and offers his hand. Schindler lets it hang there. SCHINDLER You expect me to walk home, or what? GESTAPO CLERK (tightly) Bring a car around for Mr. Schindler. EXT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY A Gestapo limousine pulls in through the gates of the factory, parks near the loading docks. The driver, the same SS officer, waits for Schindler to climb out, but he doesn't; he waits for the SS man to come around and open the door for him. SCHINDLER If you'd return the ledgers to my office I'd appreciate it. There are no less than forty able-bodied Jewish laborers working on the docks, any one of which would be better suited to the task. The Gestapo man calls to one of them. SCHINDLER Excuse me -- hey -- (the guy turns) They're working. The guy just stares. Finally he heads off with the ledgers. The poodle bounds out past him and over to Schindler. He gives the dog a pat on the head. EXT. SCHINDLER'S BUILDING - EVENING Elegantly dressed for a night out, Schindler and Klonowska emerge from the building. As they're escorted to the waiting car, Schindler hesitates. A nervous figure in the shadows of an alcove is gesturing to him, beckoning him. Schindler excuses himself. Klonowska watches as he joins the man in the alcove. Their whispered conversation is over quickly and the man hurries off. EXT. PROKOCIM DEPOT - CRACOW - LATER - NIGHT From the locomotive, looking back, the string of splattered livestock carriages stretches into darkness. There's a lot of activity on the platform. Guards mill. Handcards piled with luggage trundle by. People hand up children to others already in the cars and climb aboard after them. The clerks are out in full force with their lists and clipboards, reminding the travelers to label their suitcases. Climbing from his Mercedes, Schindler stares. He's heard of this, but actually seeing the juxtaposition -- human and cattle cars -- this is something else. Recovering, he tells Klonowska to stay in the car and, moving along the side of the train, calls Stern's name to the faces peering out from behind the slats and barbed wire. AN ENORMOUS LIST OF NAMES -- -- several pages-worth on a clipboard; a Gestapo clerk methodically leafing through them. SCHINDLER (O.S.) He's essential. Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt. If that happens -- CLERK Itzhak Stern? (Schindler nods) He's on the list. SCHINDLER He is. The clerk shows him the list, points out the name to him. SCHINDLER Well, let's find him. CLERK He's on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list. You can't have him. SCHINDLER I'm talking to a clerk. Schindler pulls out a small notepad and drops his voice to a hard murmur, the growl of a reasonable man who isn't ready -- yet -- to bring out his heavy guns: SCHINDLER What's your name? CLERK Sir, the list is correct. SCHINDLER I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name. CLERK Klaus Tauber. As Schindler writes it down, the clerk has second thoughts and calls to a superior, an SS sergeant, who comes over. CLERK The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made. SCHINDLER My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why. The sergeant takes a good hard look at the clothes, at the pin, at the man wearing them. SERGEANT (to the clerk) Is he on the list? CLERK Yes, sir. SERGEANT (to Schindler) The list is correct, sir. There's nothing I can do. SCHINDLER May as well get your name while you're here. SERGEANT My name? My name is Kunder. Sergeant Kunder. What's yours? SCHINDLER Schindler. The sergeant takes out a pad. Now all three of them have lists. He jots down Schindler's name. Schindler jots down his and flips the pad closed. SCHINDLER Sergeant, Mr. Tauber, thank you very much. I think I can guarantee you you'll both be in Southern Russia before the end of the month. Good evening. He walks away, back toward his car. The clerk and sergeant smile. But slowly, slowly, the smiles sour at the possibility that this man calmly walking away from them could somehow arrange such a fate... ALL THREE OF THEM -- -- Schindler, the clerk and the sergeant -- stride along the side of the cars. Two of them are calling out loudly -- CLERK & SERGEANT Stern! Itzhak Stern! Soon it seems as if everybody except Schindler is yelling out the name. As they reach the last few cars, the accountant's face appears through the slats. SCHINDLER There he is. SERGEANT Open it. Guards yank at a lever, slide the gate open. Stern climbs down. The clerk draws a line through his name on the list and hands the clipboard to Schindler. CLERK Initial it, please. (Schindler initials the change) And this... As Schindler signs three or four forms, the guards slide the carriage gate closed. Those left inside seem grateful for the extra space. CLERK It makes no difference to us, you understand -- this one, that one. It's the inconvenience to the list. It's the paperwork. Schindler returns the clipboard. The sergeant motions to another who motions to the engineer. As the train pulls out, Stern tries to keep up with Schindler who's striding away. STERN I somehow left my work card at home. I tried to tell them it was a mistake, but they -- Schindler silences him with a look. He's livid. Stern glances down at the ground. STERN I'm sorry. It was stupid. (contrite) Thank you. Schindler turns away and heads for the car. Stern hurries after him. They pass an area where all the luggage, carefully tagged, has been left -- the image becoming BLACK and WHITE. EXT./INT. MECHANICS GARAGE - NIGHT Mechanics' hood-lamps throw down pools of light through which me wheel handcarts piled high with suitcases, briefcases, steamer trunks -- BLACK and WHITE. Moving along with one of the handcarts into a huge garage past racks of clothes, each item tagged, past musical instruments, furniture, paintings, against one wall -- children's toys, sorted by size. The cart stops. A valise is handed to someone who dumps and sorts the contents on a greasy table. The jewelry is taken to another area, to a pit, one of two deep lubrication bays filled with watches, bracelets, necklaces, candelabra, Passover platters, gold in one, silver the other, and tossed in. At workbenches, four Jewish jewelers under SS guard sift and sort and weigh and grade diamonds, pearls, pendants, brooches children's rings -- faltering only once, when a uniformed figure upends a box, spilling out gold teeth smeared with blood -- the image saturating with COLOR. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY Fractured gravestones like broken teeth jut from the earth of a neglected Jewish cemetery outside of town. Down the road that runs alongside it comes a German staff car. INT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY In the backseat, Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth pulls on a flask of schnapps. His age and build are about that of Schindler's; his face open and pleasant. GOETH Make a nice driveway. The other SS officers in the car -- Knude, Haase and Hujar -- aren't sure what he means. He's peering out the window at the tombstones. EXT. GHETTO - DAY The staff car passes through the portals of the ghetto and down the trolley lines of Lwowska Street. INT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY As the car slowly cruises through the ghetto, Knude, like a tour guide, briefs the new man, Goeth -- KNUDE This street divides the ghetto just about in half. On the right -- Ghetto A: civil employees, industry workers, so on. On the left, Ghetto B: surplus labor, the elderly mostly. Which is where you'll probably want to start. The look Goeth gives Knude tells him to refrain, if he would, from offering tactical opinions. KNUDE Of course that's entirely up to you. EXT. PLASZOW FORCED LABOR SITE - DAY Outside of town, a previously abandoned limestone quarry lies nestled between two hills. The stone and brick buildings look like they've been here forever; the wooden structures, those that are up, are built of freshly-cut lumber. There's a great deal of activity. New construction and renovation -- foundations being poured, rail tracks being laid, fences and watchtowers going up, heavy segments of huts -- wall panels, eaves sections -- being dragged uphill by teams of bescarved women like some ancient Egyptian industry. Goeth surveys the site from a knoll, clearly pleased with it. But then he's distracted by voices -- a man's, a woman's -- arguing down where some barracks are being erected. The woman breaks off the dialog with a disgusted wave of her hand and stalks back to a half-finished barracks. The man, one from the car, Hujar, sees Goeth, Knude and Haase coming down the hill and moves to meet them. HUJAR She says the foundation was poured wrong, she's got to take it down. I told her it's a barracks, not a fucking hotel, fucking Jew engineer. Goeth watches the woman moving around the shell of the building, pointing, directing, telling the workers to take it all down. He goes to take a closer look. She comes over. ENGINEER The entire foundation has to be dug up and re-poured. If it isn't, the thing will collapse before it's even completed. Goeth considers the foundation as if he knew about such things. He nods pensively. Then turns to Hujar. GOETH (calmly) Shoot her. It's hard to tell which is more stunned by the order, the woman or Hujar. Both stare at Goeth in disbelief. He gives her the reason along with a shrug -- GOETH You argued with my man. (to Hujar) Shoot her. Hujar unholsters his pistol but holds it limply at his side. The workers become aware of what's happening and still their hammers. HUJAR Sir... Goeth groans and takes the gun from him and puts it to the woman's head. Calmly to her -- GOETH I'm sure you're right. He fires. She crumples to the ground. He returns the gun to his stunned inferior and, gesturing down at the body, addresses the workers. GOETH That's somebody who knew what they were doing. That's somebody I needed. (pause) Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild it, like she said. He turns and walks away. EXT. STABLES - DAWN Stable boys lead two horses into the pre-dawn light. The animals' hoofs shatter tufts of weeds like fingers of glass; fog plumes from their nostrils. EXT. PARK, CRACOW - DAWN In addition to the exhaust from idling trucks and the curling smoke from the Sonderkommando units' cigarettes, there is excitement in the chilly pre-dawn air. EXT. GHETTO - DAWN An empty street. Rooftops against a lightening sky. A few of the windows in the buildings are lighted, glowing amber; the majority are still dark. EXT. STABLES - DAWN The stable boys hoist saddles onto the horses, cinch the straps. Leaning against the hood of the Mercedes, Schindler and Ingrid, in long hacking jackets, riding breeches and boots, share cognac from his flask. EXT. PARK, CRACOW - DAWN Untersturmfuhrer Goeth, soon to be Commandant Goeth, stands before the assembled troops with a flask of cognac in his hand. He looks out over them proudly; they're good boys, these, the best. He addresses them -- GOETH Today is history. The young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are a part of it. EXT. PEACE SQUARE, GHETTO - DAWN A fourteen year old kid hurries across to the square pulling on his O.D. armband. Several others of the Jewish Ghetto Police, Golberg among them, are already assembled there. The clerks, the list makers, scissor open their folding tables, set out their ink pads and stamps. GOETH (V.O.) When, elsewhere, they were footing the blame for the Black Death, Kazimierz the Great, so called, told the Jews they could come to Cracow. They came. EXT. STABLES - DAWN Ingrid climbs onto one of the horses, Schindler onto the other. As the animals gallop away with their riders toward a wood, the stable boys wave. GOETH (V.O.) They trundled their belongings into this city, they settled, they took hold, they prospered. EXT. PARK, CRACOW - DAWN The fresh young faces of the Sonderkommandos, listening to their commander. GOETH For six centuries, there has been a Jewish Cracow. EXT. WOODS - DAWN The horses panting hard. Their hoofs hammering at the ground, climbing a hill. Riding boots kicking at their flanks. EXT. PARK, CRACOW - DAWN The boots of Amon Goeth slowly pacing. He stops. Tight on his face, smiling pleasantly. GOETH By this weekend, those six centuries, they're a rumor. They never happened. Today is history. EXT. HILLTOP CLEARING - DAWN The galloping horses break through to a clearing high on a hill. The riders pull in the reins and the hoofs rip at the earth. Schindler smiles at the view, the beauty of it with the sun just coming up. From here, all of Cracow can be seen in striking relief, like a model of a town. He can see the Vistula, the river that separates the ghetto from Kazimierz; Wawel Castle, from where the National Socialist Party's Hans Frank rules the Government General of Poland; beyond it, the center of town. He begins to notice refinements: the walls that define the ghetto; Peace Square, the assembly of men and boys. He notices a line of trucks rolling east across the Kosciuscko Bridge, and another across the bridge at Podgorze, a third along Zablocie Street, all angling in on the ghetto like spokes to a hub. EXT. GHETTO - DAY The wheels of the last truck clear the portals at Lwowska Street and the Sonderkommandos jump down. INT. APARTMENT BUILDINGS - DAWN Families are routed from their apartments. An appeal to be allowed to pack is answered with a rifle butt; an unannounced move to a desk drawer is countered with a shot. EXT. STREETS, GHETTO - DAWN Spilling out of the buildings, they're herded into lines without regard to family consideration; some other unfathomable system is at work here. The wailing protests of a woman to join her husband's line are abruptly cut off by a short burst of gunfire. EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN From here, the action down below seems staged, unreal; the rifle bursts no louder than caps. Dismounting, Schindler moves closer to the edge of the hill, curious. His attention is drawn to a small distant figure, all in red, at the rear of one of the many columns. EXT. STREET - DAWN Small red shoes against a forest of gleaming black boots. A Waffen SS man occasionally corrects the little girl's drift, fraternally it seems, nudging her gently back in line with the barrel of his rifle. A volley of shots echoes from up the street. EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN Schindler watches as the girl slowly wanders away unnoticed by the SS. Against the grays of the buildings and street she's like a moving red target. EXT. STREET - DAWN A truck thundering down the street obscures her for a moment. Then she's moving past a pile of bodies, old people executed in the street. EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN Schindler watches: she's so conspicuous, yet she keeps moving -- past crowds, past dogs, past trucks -- as though she were invisible. EXT. STREET - DAWN Patients in white gowns, and doctors and nurses in white, are herded out the doors of a convalescent hospital. The small figure in red moves past them. Shots explode behind her. EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN Short bursts of light flash throughout the ghetto like stars. Schindler, fixated on the figure in red, loses sight of her as she turns a corner. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN She climbs the stairs. The building is empty. She steps inside an apartment and moves through it. It's been ransacked. As she crawls under the bed, the scene DRAINS of COLOR. The gunfire outside sounds like firecrackers. EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT NIGHT Silence. Schindler and Ingrid are gone. Below, the ghetto lies like a void within the city, its perimeter and interior clearly distinguishable by darkness. Outside it, the lights of the rest of Cracow glimmer. INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - NIGHT Tables and tools and enamelware scrap. The metal presses and lathes, still. The firing ovens, cold. The gauges at zero. Against the wall of windows overlooking the empty factory floor stands a figure, Schindler, in silhouette against the glass, black against white, not moving, just staring down. EXT. FOREST - PLASZOW - MORNING Bloody wheelbarrows, stark against the tree line of a forest above the completed forced labor camp, PLASZOW. EXT. PLASZOW FORCED LABOR CAMP - MORNING Names on lists. Names called out. Tight on faces. Goldberg at one of several folding tables. The gangsterturned -- ghetto-cop is now the Lord of Lists inside Plaszow. He and other listmakers call out names, accounting for those thousands who survived the liquidation of the ghetto and now stand before them in long straight rows. INT. GOETH'S BEDROOM, PLASZOW - MORNING Amon Goeth stirs, wakes, glances at the woman asleep beside him. Hungover, he drags himself slowly out of bed. EXT. GOETH'S BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER - MORNING Goeth steps out onto the balcony in his undershirt and shorts and peers out across the labor camp, his labor camp, his kingdom. Satisfied with it, even amazed, he's reminiscent of Schindler looking down on his kingdom, his factory, as he loves to do, from his wall of glass. Life is great. Goeth reaches for a rifle. EXT. PLASZOW SAME TIME - MORNING Workers loading quarry rock onto trolleys under Ukrainian guard and a low morning sun. Every so often, one glances with anticipation to the balcony of Goeth's "villa" -- which is in fact nothing more than a two-story stone house perched on a slight rise in the dry landscape. EXT. GOETH'S BALCONY - CONTINUED - MORNING The butt of the rifle against his shoulder, Goeth aims down at the quarry -- at this worker, at that one -- indiscriminately, inscrutably. He fires a shot and a distant figure falls. INT. GOETH'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MORNING The woman in bed groans at the echoing shot. She's used to it but she still hates it; it's such an awful way to be woken. MAJOLA (mutters) Amon... Christ... She buries her head under a pillow. Goeth reappears. He pads to his bathroom, goes inside and urinates. EXT. PLASZOW - DAY Schindler's Mercedes winds through the camp, past warehouses and workshops, trucks full of furs and furniture, work details, barracks, guard blocks. A man standing alone wears a sign around his neck -- "I am a potato thief." EXT. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY The Mercedes pulls in next to some other nice cars parked on a driveway made of tombstones from the Jewish cemetery. EXT. PATIO, GOETH'S VILLA - DAY A patio table set with crystal, china, silver. Goeth and Hujar are there, in pressed SS uniforms, and two industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch. One chair is empty. HUJAR Your machinery will be moved and installed by the SS at no cost to you. You will pay no rent, no maintenance -- Hujar glances off, interrupted by Schindler's arrival. Although he's never been here, the industrialist comes in like he owns the place. All but Goeth rise. SCHINDLER No, no, come on, sit -- He works his way around the table, patting Bosch and Madritsch on the back -- he knows them -- shaking Hujar's hand, who he doesn't know. He reaches Goeth. SCHINDLER How you doing? Goeth takes a good long look at the handsomely dressed entrepreneur and allows him to shake his hand. GOETH We started without you. SCHINDLER Good. Schindler takes a seat, shakes a napkin onto his lap, nods to the servant holding out a bottle of champagne to him. SCHINDLER Please. Goeth watches him. The others watch Goeth. SCHINDLER I miss anything important? HUJAR I was explaining to Mr. Bosch and Mr. Madritsch some of the benefits of moving their factories into Plaszow. SCHINDLER Oh, good, yeah. Schindler clearly doesn't care, but nods as though he did. He drinks. Goeth just watches him with what seems to be growing amusement. He nods to Hujar to continue. HUJAR Since your labor is housed on-site, it's available to you at all times. You can work them all night if you want. Your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past, they'll continue to be, they'll be respected -- Schindler laughs out loud, cutting Hujar off. Hujar glances over to Goeth nonplussed. SCHINDLER I'm sorry. He's not sorry at all, and starts in on the plate of food that's set down in front of him. GOETH You know, they told me you were going to be trouble -- Czurda and Scherner. SCHINDLER You're kidding. Goeth slowly shakes his head no... then smiles. GOETH He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know -- where do you get a suit like that? what is that, silk? (Schindler nods) It's great. SCHINDLER I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know. He shrugs like, those are the breaks, too bad. Goeth just smiles. The others watch the two of them, unsure how they're supposed to react. INT. GOETH'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY The others have gone. It's just Goeth and Schindler now. Goeth pours glasses of cognac. GOETH Something wonderful's happened, do you know what it is? Without planning it, we've reached that happy point in our careers where duty and financial opportunity meet. Schindler nods pensively, perhaps in agreement, perhaps at some other thought. There's a silence, broken finally by -- SCHINDLER I go to work the other day, there's nobody there. Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -- GOETH They're not gone, they're here. SCHINDLER They're mine! His voice echoes into silence. An acquiescent shrug from Goeth finally. And a nod; Schindler's right. SCHINDLER Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money -- I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -- GOETH We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -- SCHINDLER (cutting him off) It's bad business. GOETH (shrugs) Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do? You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done. (pause) Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. But that's good business. Schindler pours himself another shot from the bottle, nurses it. He's in a foul mood. They study each other, trying to determine perhaps who's more powerful. Eventually -- GOETH Scherner told me something else about you. SCHINDLER Yeah, what's that? GOETH That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys. SCHINDLER True. Goeth tries to put the situation in perspective: GOETH You want to stay where you are. You got things going on the side, things are good, you don't want anybody telling you what to do -- I can understand all that. (pause) What you want is your own sub-camp. Schindler admits it by not disagreeing. Goeth thinks about it, nods to himself again, then frowns. GOETH Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone? Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy. Then the engineers show up. They stand around and they argue about drainage -- I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know. SCHINDLER Well, you've been through it. You know. You could make things easier for me. Goeth mulls it over, his shrug saying "maybe, maybe not." A silence before -- SCHINDLER I'd be grateful. There's the word Goeth was waiting to hear. EXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP SITE - DAY An SS surveyor, with even paces, measures a distance of the bare field adjacent to the factory. He sticks a little flag into the ground. EXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP SITE - DAY A watchtower, half-erected, the little flag still in the ground. Laborers hammer at it while others roll out barbed wire fencing. A surveyor supervises the placement of a post and carefully measures its heights; it has to be nine feet, exactly. At a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler signs checks made out to the Construction Office, Plaszow -- requisitioning more lumber, cement and hardware. EXT. CONSTRUCTION OFFICE, PLASZOW - DAY Plaszow prisoners load the requisitioned building supplies -- the lumber, cement and hardware -- onto trucks. EXT/INT. WAREHOUSE, CRACOW - DAY The trucks parked not at Schindler's sub-camp, but at the loading dock of Goeth's private warehouse in Cracow. Inside the building can be glimpsed all kinds of Plaszow goods: clothes, food, construction equipment, furniture. Checkbook laid out on the hood of his Mercedes, Schindler pays for the requested materials a second time -- this time with a check made out to Amon Goeth personally -- and hands it over to his bagman, Hujar. EXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP FIELD - DAY Some SS architects groan over a set of blueprints. Schindler and an SS officer walk by. SS OFFICER You have the Poles beat the Czechs, you have the Czechs beat the Poles, that way everybody stays in line. SCHINDLER All I have is Jews. He shrugs, Too bad, what're you going to do? The SS guy has to think. Yeah, that's a problem. Two huge leashed dogs yank another SS man across their path. EXT. D.E.F. - DAY As five hundred Plaszow prisoners are marched back onto the grounds of D.E.F., any hope they may have had of a more lenient environment is quickly dashed. The place -- completed -- looks like a fortress: barbed-wire, towers, SS guards and dogs. INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY Where once they glimpsed the not too threatening figure of Oskar Schindler strolling through the factory, the workers who dare glance up now find armed guards moving past. And further up, behind the wall of windows, Schindler moving around, entertaining SS officer. INT. GOETH'S VILLA - NIGHT The Rosner brothers in evening clothes, Leo on accordion, Henry on violin, playing a Strauss melody, trying to keep it muted, inoffensive. Few of the guests pay attention, which is fine with them. An SS officer chats with Schindler. LEO JOHN -- she's seventy years old, she's been there forever -- they bomb her house. Everything's gone. The furniture, everything. SCHINDLER (well aware the man is lying) Thank God she wasn't there. Schindler, with yet another girl on his arm, endures the officer's lies while sweeping the room with his eyes. LEO JOHN I was thinking maybe you could help her out. Some plates and mugs, some stew pots, I don't know. Say half a gross of everything? Schindler looks at him for the first time, knowingly. SCHINDLER She run an orphanage, your aunt? LEO JOHN She's old. What she can't use maybe she can sell. Schindler's girl excuses herself to get a drink. SCHINDLER You want it sent directly to her or through you? LEO JOHN Through me, I think. I'd like to enclose a card. Schindler nods, Done. Both watch his date across the room getting a drink. As usual, she's the best-looking on there. LEO JOHN Your wife must be a saint. Whatever tolerance Schindler's had up to this point with John leaves his face; the looks he gives him now is pure contempt. SCHINDLER She is. INT. GOETH'S VILLA - LATER - NIGHT Goeth's girl tonight, a Pole, eighteen, nineteen, places a hand on Schindler's sleeve. They're at the important end of the large table with Goeth, along with Czurda and Leo John and their girlfriends. GOETH'S GIRL You're not a soldier? SCHINDLER No, dear. CZURDA There's a picture. Private Schindler? Blanket around his shoulders over in Kharkov? Everyone laughs. GOETH Happened to what's his name -- up in Warsaw -- and he was bigger than you, Oskar. CZURDA Toebbens. GOETH Happened to Toebbens. Almost. Himmler goes up to Warsaw, tells the armament guys, "Get the fucking Jews out of Toebbens' factory and put Toebbens in the army," and -- "and sent him to the Front." I mean, the Front. Everybody laughs. GOETH It's true. Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much. SCHINDLER I pay you too much. Another round of laughs, only this time it's forced. Everybody knows it's true, but you don't say it out loud, and Schindler knows better. Goeth gives him a look; they'll talk later. EXT. GOETH'S VILLA - LATER - NIGHT Goeth finds Schindler alone outside smoking a cigarette. Schindler acknowledges him, but that's about it. Finally -- SCHINDLER You held back Stern. You held back the one man most important to my business. GOETH He's important to my business. SCHINDLER What do you want for him, I'll give it to you. GOETH I want him. (turning back) Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time. Goeth heads back inside. Schindler stays outside, finishing his cigarette. EXT. PLASZOW - LATER - NIGHT A folding table outside the prisoners' barracks. At it, playing cards, two night sentries. A figure appears out of the darkness. Schindler. He sets down on the table a fifth of vodka. EXT. BARRACKS - LATER - NIGHT Stern, summoned from his barracks, watches as Schindler digs through his coat pockets. Nearby, at the table, drinking now, the sentries. From the hill, the villa, the Rosners' music, faint, can be heard. SCHINDLER Here. He discreetly hands over to the accountant some cigars scavenged from the party. From another pocket, he retrieves and hands over some tins of food -- all valuable commodities. From another pocket, perhaps not so valuable, but then who knows, a gold lighter. Regarding this last item -- SCHINDLER This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something. STERN Thank you. Schindler shrugs, It's the least I can do. The two stand around a moment more before Schindler shrugs again, Sorry I can't do more. He reaches out, pats Stern on the shoulder, and, turning to leave. SCHINDLER I got to go, I'll see you. STERN Oskar -- Schindler comes back, but, out of embarrassment or -- maybe he wants to get back to the party -- waits with some impatience for Stern to tell whatever it is he wants to tell him. Lowering his voice -- STERN There's a guy. This thing happened. Goeth came into the metalworks -- CUT TO: INT. METALWORKS - PLASZOW - DAY Goeth moves through the crowded metalworks like a goodnatured foreman, nodding to this worker, wishing that one a good morning. He seems satisfied, even pleased, with the level of production. Goldberg is with him. They reach a particular bench, a particular worker, and Goeth smiles pleasantly. GOETH What are you making? Not daring to look up, all the worker sees of Goeth is the starched cuff of his shirt. LEVARTOV Hinges, sir. The rabbi-turned-metalworker gestures with his head to a pile of hinges on the floor. Goeth nods. And in a tone more like a friend than anything else -- GOETH I got some workers coming in tomorrow... Where the hell they from again? GOLDBERG Yugoslavia. GOETH Yugoslavia. I got to make room. He shrugs apologetically and pulls out a pocket watch. GOETH Make me a hinge. As Goeth times him, Rabbi Levartov works at making a hinge as though his life depended on it -- which it does -- cutting the pieces, wrenching them together, smoothing the edges, all the while keeping count on his head of the seconds ticking away. He finishes and lets it fall onto the others on the floor. Forty seconds. GOETH Another. Again the rabbi works feverishly -- cutting, crimping, sanding, hearing the seconds ticking in his head -- and finishing in thirty-five. Goeth nods, impressed. GOETH That's very good. What I don't understand, though, is -- you've been working since what, about six this morning? Yet such a small pile of hinges? He understands perfectly. So does Levartov; he has just crafted his own death in exactly 75 seconds. Goeth stands him against the workshop wall and adjusts his shoulders. He pulls out his pistol, puts it to the rabbi's head and pulls the trigger... click. GOETH (mumble) Christ -- Annoyed, Goeth extracts the bullet-magazine, slaps it back in and puts the barrel back to the man's head. He pulls the trigger again... and again there's a click. GOETH God damn it -- He slams the weapon across Levartov's face and the rabbi slumps dazed to the floor. Looking up into Goeth's face, he knows it's not over. As Goeth walks away -- CUT BACK TO: EXT. BARRACKS - CONTINUED - NIGHT Tight on Schindler, a pensive nod, then a shrug. SCHINDLER The guy can turn out a hinge in less than a minute? Why the long story? INT. D.E.F. - DAY Rabbi Levartov, brought over to D.E.F., works at a table with several others. As Schindler strolls by, the rabbi dares to speak -- LEVARTOV Thank you, sir. Schindler has to think a moment before he can figure out who the grateful man is. SCHINDLER Oh, yeah. You're welcome. EXT. PLASZOW - DAY A dead chicken dangling from Hujar's hand, evidence of some kind. Goeth slowly pacing before a work detail of twenty or so men standing still, silent, in a row. GOETH Nobody knows who stole the chicken. A man walks around with a chicken, nobody notices this. No one confesses. Goeth nods, All right, takes a rifle from a guard and shoots one of the workers at random. With this added incentive, he waits for someone to tell him who stole the chicken. No one does. GOETH Still nobody knows. He shrugs, Okay, points the rifle at another worker -- and a boy of fourteen, shuddering and weeping, steps out of line. GOETH There we go. Goeth goes over to the boy, and, like a distant relative to a small child, tries to get him to look at his face. GOETH It was you? You committed this crime? BOY No, sir. GOETH You know who, though. The boy nods, weeps, screams -- BOY Him! He's pointing at the dead man. And Goeth astonishes the entire assembly of workers and guards by believing the boy. He returns the rifle to the guard and walks away. Hujar stares after him, then knowingly at the boy. EXT. PLASZOW - DAY A truck being loaded with supplies. Schindler signs for it and, appearing as rushed as he always does, returns the clipboard to Stern. SCHINDLER Yeah, sure, bring him over. INT. D.E.F. - DAY Schindler comes down the stairs with Klonowska. As they're crossing through the factory -- BOY Thank you, sir. SCHINDLER (distracted) That's okay. INT. MECHANICS' GARAGE - PLASZOW - DAY A mechanic peering under the hood of Goeth's Adler. Leaning in he accidentally knocks a wrench off the radiator into the fan and there's an awful clatter before the engine dies. The mechanic glances up horrified. EXT. GOETH'S VILLA - DAY As servants hoist a heavy, elaborately tooled saddle from Schindler's trunk - a gift for Goeth -- Schindler sees Stern coming toward him and glances skyward long-sufferingly. INT. D.E.F. - DAY The mechanic, making adjustments to a metal press, glances up as Schindler moves past. MECHANIC Thank -- SCHINDLER Yeah, yeah, yeah. EXT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY Across the street stands a nervous young woman in a faded dress. She seems to be trying to summon the courage to cross over and onto the factory grounds. INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY Just inside the factory, she waits as a guard telephones Schindler's office. She can see the wall of windows from where she's standing, and Schindler himself as he appears at it, phone to his ear. He glances down at her disapprovingly and the guard hangs up. GUARD He won't see you. INT. APARTMENT - CRACOW - DAY The woman alone in a dismal room pulling on nylon stockings. At a mirror, she applies make-up. She slips into a provocative dress. Puts on heels. A Parisian hat. And looks in the mirror. INT. D.E.F. - DAY Schindler waits for her on the landing of the stairs. He doesn't recognize her, but smiles to counter the unfortunately possibility she's some old girlfriend he's forgotten. Reaching him, she offers her hand. SCHINDLER Miss Krause. MISS KRAUSE How do you do? He can tell now she doesn't know him. He seems relieved. He leads her past Klonowska's desk and into his office. INT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - DAY He arranges a chair for her, goes to his liquor cabinet. SCHINDLER Pernod? Cognac? MISS KRAUSE No, thank you. He pours himself a drink, warms it in his hands, smiles, clearly take with her. SCHINDLER So. The grace with which she's carried herself up to this point seems to evaporate as she struggles to find the words she wants. MISS KRAUSE They say that no one dies here. They say your factory is a haven. They say you are good. Schindler's face changes like a wall going up, a mask of indifference like in the portrait of Adolf Hitler on the wall behind him. SCHINDLER Who says that? MISS KRAUSE Everyone. Schindler glances away from her. He seems weary suddenly, depressed. MISS KRAUSE My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause. I've been living in Cracow on false papers since the ghetto massacre. (pause) My parents are in Plaszow. They're old. They're killing old people in Plaszow now. They bury them up in the forest. I have no money. I borrowed these clothes. Will you bring them here? Schindler glances back at her, his face hard, cold, and studies her for a long, long moment before -- SCHINDLER I don't do that. You've been misled. I ask one thing: whether or not a worker has certain skills. That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office. She stares at him, frightened and bewildered. She feels tears welling up. SCHINDLER Cry and I'll have you arrested, I swear to God. She hurries out. INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - PLASZOW - DAY Schindler barges into Stern's office. In a foul and aggressive mood, he dispenses with pleasantries in order to admonish the accountant -- SCHINDLER People die, it's a fact of life. Stern has hardly had time to look up from the work on his desk. SCHINDLER He wants to kill everybody? Great. What am I supposed to do, bring everybody over? Is that what you think? Yeah, send them over to Schindler, send them all. His place is a "haven," didn't you know? It's not a factory, it's not an enterprise of any kind, it's a haven for people with no skills whatsoever. Stern's look is all innocence, but Schindler knows better. SCHINDLER You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time? I know. STERN (with concern) Are you losing money? SCHINDLER No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point. STERN What other point is -- SCHINDLER (interrupts; yells) It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally. Silence. Schindler tries to settle down. Then -- SCHINDLER You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people -- he's got a lot of things to worry about. And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right. There'd be just the good aspects of him. Which is a wonderful crook. A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money... STERN And killing. SCHINDLER I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. (pause) All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it? STERN There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office. But it isn't Stern who needs convincing; it's Schindler himself. It's doubtful he even realizes this, but it's clear to Stern. Schindler sighs either at the predicament itself, or at the fact that he's allowed Stern to place him right in the middle of it. He turns to leave, hesitates. He conducts a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it: SCHINDLER Perlman, husband and wife. He unstraps his watch, hands it to Stern. SCHINDLER Give it to Goldberg, have him send them over. He leaves. EXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - NIGHT Distant music, Brahms' lullaby, from the Rosner Brothers way down by the women's barracks calming the inhabitants. Up here on the balcony, Schindler and Goeth, the latter so drunk he can barely stand up, stare out over Goeth's dark kingdom. SCHINDLER They don't fear us because we have the power to kill, they fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should know better. We have him killed, we feel pretty good about it. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. That's not power, though, that's justice. That's different than power. Power is when we have every justification to kill -- and we don't. That's power. That's what the emperors had. A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the floor, he begs for mercy, he knows he's going to die... and the emperor pardons him. This worthless man. He lets him go. That's power. That's power. It seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint, this image Schindler has brush-stroked of the merciful emperor, holds some appeal to Goeth. Perhaps, as he stares out over his camp, he imagines himself in the role, wondering what the power Schindler describes might feel like. Eventually, he glances over drunkenly, and almost smiles. SCHINDLER Amon the Good. EXT. STABLES - PLASZOW - DAY A stable boy works to ready Goeth's horse before he arrives. He sticks a bridle into its mouth, throws a riding blanket onto its back, drags out the saddle Schindler bought Goeth. Before he can finish, though, Goeth is there. The boy tries to hide his panic; he knows others have been shot for less. STABLE BOY I'm sorry, sir, I'm almost done. GOETH Oh, that's all right. As Goeth waits, patiently it seems, whistling to himself, the stable boy tries to mask his confusion. EXT. PLASZOW - DAY Goeth gallops around his great domain holding himself high in the saddle. But everywhere he looks, it seems, he's confronted with stoop-shouldered sloth. He forces himself to smile benevolently. INT. GOETH'S VILLA - DAY Goeth comes into his bedroom sweating from his ride. A worker with a pail and cloth appears in the bathroom doorway. MORE TO THE FLOOR -- WORKER I have to report, sir, I've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub. Goeth steps past him to take a look. The worker is almost shaking, he's so terrified of the violent reprisal he expects to receive. GOETH What are you using? WORKER Soap, sir. GOETH (incredulous) Soap? Not lye? The worker hasn't a defense for himself. Goeth's hand drifts down as if by instinct to the gun in his holster. He stares at the worker. He so wants to shoot him he can hardly stand it, right here, right in the bathroom, put some more stains on the porcelain. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. Then gestures grandly. GOETH Go ahead, go on, leave. I pardon you. The worker hurries out with his pail and cloth. Goeth just stands there for several moments -- trying to feel the power of emperors he's supposed to be feeling. But he doesn't feel it. All he feels is stupid. EXT. GOETH'S VILLA - MOMENTS LATER - DAY The worker hurries across the dying lawn outside the villa. He dares a glance back, and at that moment, a hand with a gun appears out the bathroom window and fires. EXT. BARRACKS, PLASZOW - NIGHT The sentries at their little table again, drinking Schindler's vodka. Nearby, Schindler and Stern outside Stern's barracks. The accountant's tone is hushed: STERN If he didn't steal so much, I could hide it. If he's steal with some discretion... CUT TO: STERN'S OFFICE, PLASZOW - DAY Goldberg delivers a stack of requisitions and invoices, and leaves without a word. Behind his desk, Stern takes a cursory look at them and shakes his head in dismay. INT. GOLDBERG'S OFFICE, PLASZOW - MINUTES LATER - DAY Stern comes in with the requisitions. Now it's Goldberg's turn to shake his head in dismay; he doesn't want to hear it -- STERN There are fifteen thousand people here -- GOLDBERG Goeth says there's twenty-five. STERN There are fifteen. He wants to say sixteen, seventeen, all right, maybe he can get away with it, but ten thousand over? It's stupid. GOLDBERG Stern, do me a favor, get out of here. You want to argue about it, go tell Goeth. LOADING DOCK, PLASZOW - DAY Stern watches truck being unloaded of bags of flour, rice and other supplies. Goeth nods to Hujar. Hujar calls a halt. The workers climb down, close up the trucks. And, still half full, the trucks rumble off. STERN (V.O.) The SS auditors keep coming around, looking over the books -- Goeth knows this -- EXT. CRACOW - DAY The trucks at the loading dock of Goeth's private warehouse. Polish workers, under Hujar's supervision, throwing down the "surplus" bags of flour and rice -- the supplies for the phantom 10,000 prisoners. STERN (V.O.) -- you'd think he'd have the common sense to see what's coming. No, he steals with complete impunity. CUT BACK TO: BARRACKS - CONTINUED - NIGHT They can see Goeth's villa up on the hill; figures moving around behind the windows. There's another party going on up there. Down here, as he nurses a drink from his flask, Schindler thinks about what Stern has told him, and eventually shrugs, Fine, fuck him. SCHINDLER So you'll be rid of him. But Stern slowly shakes his head 'no.' STERN If Plaszow is closed, they'll have to send us somewhere else. Where -- who knows? Gross-Rosen maybe. Maybe Auschwitz. There's the irony -- bad as it is, evil as Goeth is, it could get worse. Schindler understands. SCHINDLER I'll talk to him. STERN I think it's too late. SCHINDLER Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it. He hands over to Stern some negotiable items and leaves. INT. NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW - NIGHT Schindler and Senior SS Officers Toffel and Scherner share a table in same smoke-filled nightclub they met in. SCHINDLER What's he done that's so bad -- take money? That's a crime? Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war? We're here to make money, all of us. TOFFEL There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that. He's taking money. SCHERNER The place produces nothing. I shouldn't say that -- nothing it produces reaches the Army. That's not all right. SCHINDLER So I'll talk to him about it. SCHERNER He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though -- has he ever once shown you his appreciation? I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time -- SCHINDLER He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it? TOFFEL He's stealing from you, Oskar. SCHINDLER Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together. What is this? I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad. We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy. SCHERNER Not like him. Schindler glances away to the floor show, nods to himself. Glancing back again, he considers the SS men with great sobriety. SCHINDLER Yeah, well, in some eyes it doesn't matter the amount we steal, it's that we do it. Each of us sitting at this table. His thinly veiled threat of exposure escapes neither SS man. The air seems thicker suddenly. SCHERNER He doesn't deserve your loyalty. More important, he's not worth you making threats against us. SCHINDLER Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a simple fact. The threat still stands, despite Schindler's assurance otherwise, and they all know it. So does Scherner's threat back to him, and they all know that, too. But Schindler just grins, and, glancing away -- SCHINDLER Come on, let's watch the girls. INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY In addition to the mid-day soup and break, there are bowls of fruit on the long work tables. At one of them, several workers are debating which of them will go upstairs to thank Schindler. INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICES, D.E.F. - SAME TIME - DAY In honor of Schindler's birthday, Goeth has brought over Stern and the Rosners -- the musicians, at the moment, accompanying the best baritone in the Ukrainian garrison. Surrounded by his friends and lovers, Schindler cuts a cake. He receives congratulations from the many SS men present and the embraces, in turn, of Ingrid and Klonowska and Goeth. From Stern he gets a handshake. A Jewish girl from the shop floor is admitted and timidly approaches the drunken group around Schindler. The SS men consider her as a curiosity; Schindler, as he would any beautiful girl. The music breaks and out of the silence comes a small nervous voice: FACTORY GIRL ...On behalf of the workers... sir... I wish you a happy birthday... She hesitates. She's surrounded by SS uniforms and swastikas and holstered guns. Schindler smiles; this is a beautiful girl. SCHINDLER Thank you. He kisses her on the mouth. The smiles on the faces around them strain. Stern glances to heaven. Amon cocks his head like a confused dog. The kiss is broken, finally, and Schindler smiles again with impunity. SCHINDLER Thank them for me. The girl backs away nodding anxiously; all she wants now is out before someone -- her, Schindler, both of them -- gets shot. Henry Rosner nudges Leo and they begin another song. And the party tries to resume. EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAWN Were they not asleep in their barracks, the prisoners would no doubt shudder at the sight: the clerks are setting up their folding tables. Other figures move around the parade ground in the murky dawn light: these raising a banner, those wheeling filing cabinets across the Appellplatz, this one wiring a phonograph, that one saturating a pad with ink from a bottle. Goldberg, Lord of Lists, moves from table to table handing out carbons of lists and sharing morning pleasantries with the clerks. Some men in white appear like ghosts. A doctor's kid is opened, a stethoscope removed. Another cleans the lenses of his glasses. Someone sharpens a pencil. EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAWN A trainman waving a lantern guides an engineer who's slowly backing an empty cattle car along the tracks. It couples to another empty slatted car with a harsh clank. EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY The needle of the phonograph is set down on a pocked 78. The first scratchy note of a Strauss waltz blare from the camp speakers. EXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - DAY In his undershirt and shorts Goeth calmly smokes his first cigarette of the morning as he listens to the music wafting up from down below. Down there on the Appellplatz, the entire population of the camp has been concentrated, some fifteen thousand prisoners. EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY Though the music and banners struggle to evoke a country fair, the presence of the doctors belie it. A sorting out process is going on here, the healthy from the unhealthy. A physician wipes at his brow with his handkerchief as several prisoners run back and forth, naked, before him. He makes his selections quickly: this one into this line, that one into that, and Goldberg moves them recording the names. Other groups of people run naked in front of other doctors and clerks. Notations are made and lines are formed. The sun beats down and the music lies. EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY Some still pulling their clothes back on, the first wave of the "unfit" is marched onto the platform. A guard slides open the gate of a cattle car and this first unlucky group climbs aboard. EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY Behind the camouflage of other women prisoners, Mila Pfefferberg rubs a beet against her cheeks in desperate hope of adding a little color to her skin. Amon Goeth, his shirtsleeves uncharacteristically rolled up, chats with one of the doctors as another group strips. Whether the topic is this Health Aktion or the unseasonable weather is unclear, but he nods approvingly. PFEFFERBERG (O.S.) Commandant, sir. Goeth glances up, finds Poldek among the group taking off their clothes. Pfefferberg appeals to him with a look that asks, Do I really have to go through this, and Goeth turns to a clerk. GOETH My mechanic. Pfefferberg is motioned away from the others; he's okay, he doesn't have to be put through this indignity. He calls out to the Commandant again -- PFEFFERBERG What about my wife? Goeth thinks about it a moment before he nods, Yeah, okay, sure. A clerk accompanies Pfefferberg and, making a notation on the way, finds Mila. EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY The sun is higher, the cattle cars hotter. Prisoners' arms stretch out between the slats offering diamonds in exchange for a sip of water. EXT. PLASZOW - LATER - DAY The needle of the phonograph is set down on another record, a children's song, "Mammi, kauf mir ein Pferdchen" (Mommy, buy me a pony). Children are yanked from the arms of their parents. Wailing protests quickly escalate to brawls with the guards. Revolvers and rifles aim at the sun and fire. Music, shots, wails. INT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY Guards traipse through a deserted barracks peering up at the rafters, pulling planks from the floor, upending cots, looking for some children. EXT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY A small figure in red sprints across to another barracks, past it, to a crude wooden structure beyond it. INT. MEN'S LATRINES - SAME TIME - DAY An arm held out to either side, the small girl lowers herself into a pit into which men have defecated. She works her way slowly down, trying to find knee and toeholds on the foul walls, ignoring the flies invading her ears, her nostrils. Reaching the surface of the muck she lets her feet submerge, then her ankles, her shins, her knees, before finally touching harder ground. As she struggles to slow her breathing, her racing heart, she hears a hallucinatory murmur -- BOY'S VOICE This is our place. She sees eyes in the darkness; five other children are already there. EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY Waves of heat rise from the roofs of the long string of cattle cars. Inside, those who "failed" the medical exams bake as they wait for the last cars to be filled. Schindler's Mercedes pulls up. He climbs out and stares transfixed. He notices Goeth then, standing with the other industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch, and strolls over to them. GOETH I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought. Have a drink. SCHINDLER What's going on? GOETH I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something. He glances away at the train. The idling engine only partially covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the slatted cars. GOETH They're complaining now? They don't know what complaining is. He grins. Schindler watches as another car is loaded. It's like they're climbing into an oven. SCHINDLER What do you say we get your fire brigade out here and hose down the cars? Goeth stares at him blankly, then with a What-will-you-think- of-next? kind of look, then laughs uproariously and calls over to Hujar -- GOETH Bring the fire trucks! HUJAR What? Hujar heard him, he just doesn't get it. Finally he turns to another guy and tells him to do it. STREAM OF WATER CASCADE onto the scalding rooftops. The fire trucks are there, the hoses firing the cold water at the cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude. GOETH This is really cruel, Oskar, you're giving them hope. You shouldn't do that, that's cruel. And amusing, not just to Goeth, but to the other SS officers standing around as well. Oskar moves away to talk with one of the firemen. At full extension, apparently the hoses still only reach halfway down the long line of cars. He returns to Goeth. SCHINDLER I've got some 200-meter hoses back at D.E.F., we can reach the cars down at the end. Goeth finds this especially sidesplitting, and hollers -- GOETH Hujar! THE D.E.F. HOSES have arrived and are being coupled to Plaszow's. As the water drenches the cars further back, the people inside loudly voice their thanks, and the guards and officers outside grin at the spectacle. GUARD What does he think he's saving them from? The joke takes on new dimension when, from the back of the D.E.F. trucks, boxes of food are unloaded. Accompanied by the laughter of the SS, Schindler moves along the string of cars pushing sausages through the slats. GOETH Oh, my God. Goeth is almost hysterical. But slowly then, slowly, the amusement on his face fades. His friend moving along the cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless SS men, laughing or not, is not just behaving recklessly here, it's as though he were possessed. The water rains down on the last car. EXT. D.E.F. - DAY A German staff car pulls in across the factory gate, blocking it. Two Gestapo men climb out. INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY The girl who brought Schindler best wishes on his birthday glances up from her work to the Gestapo crossing through the factory. They climb the stairs to the upstairs offices and, moments later, appear behind Schindler's wall of glass. INT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - DAY Schindler leaning against his desk, drink in his hand, calmly tries to assess his humorless arresters. SCHINDLER I'm not saying you'll regret it, but you might. I want you to be aware of that. GESTAPO 1 We'll risk it. Schindler glances beyond them to a point outside his office, to Klonowska. She nods, she knows what to do, she'll make the phone calls, call in the favors. SCHINDLER All right, sure, it's a nice day, I'll go for a drive with you guys. He snuffs out his cigarette. INT. GESTAPO CAR - MOVING - DAY Settled comfortably in the backseat, Schindler glances idly out the window. As the car makes a turn, though, he looks back. Apparently he expected it to turn the other way. SCHINDLER Where are we going? The guys up front don't answer. Concern, for the first time, registers on Schindler's face. The car approaches a building block long with an ominous sameness to the windows. INT. MONTELUPICH PRISON - CRACOW - DAY Schindler is made to empty his pockets, his money, cigarettes, everything. Around him clerks speak in whispers, as if raised voices might set off head-splitting echoes along the narrow monotonous corridors. INT. MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY He's led down a flight of stairs into a claustrophobic tunnel. He's taken past darkened cells. Past shadowy figures crouched in corners and on the floor. INT. CELL, MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY A water bucket. A waste bucket. No windows. This is not a cell for dignitaries; this arrest is different. Schindler, incongruous with the dank surroundings in his double-breasted suit, slowly paces back and forth before his cellmate, a soldier who looks like he's been here forever, his greatcoat pulled up around his ears for warmth. SCHINDLER I violated the Race and Resettlement Act. Though I doubt they can point out the actual provision to me. (pause) I kissed a Jewish girl. Schindler forces a smile. His cellmate just stares. Now there's a crime; much more impressive, much more serious, than his own. INT. OFFICE - MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY In a stiff-backed chair sits a very unlikely defender of racial improprieties -- Amon Goeth. To an impassive SS colonel behind a desk, Goeth tries to highlight extenuating circumstances: GOETH He likes women. He likes good-looking women. He sees a good-looking woman, he doesn't think. This guy has so many women. They love him. He's married, he's got all these women. All right, she was Jewish, he shouldn't have done it. But you didn't see this girl. I saw this girl. This girl was very good-looking. Goeth tries to read the guy behind the desk, but his face is like a wall. GOETH They cast a spell on you, you know, the Jews. You work closely with them like I do, you see this. They have this power, it's like a virus. Some of my men are infected with this virus. They should be pitied, not punished. They should receive treatment, because this is as real as typhus. I see this all the time. Goeth shifts in his chair; he knows he's not getting anywhere with this guy. He switches tacts: GOETH It's a matter of money? We can discuss that. That'd be all right with me. In the silence that follows, Goeth realizes he has made a serious error in judgment. This man sitting soberly before him is one of that rare breed -- the unbribable official. SS COLONEL You're offering me a bribe? GOETH A "bribe?" No, no, please come on... a gratuity. Suddenly the man stands up and salutes, which thoroughly confuses Goeth since Goeth is his inferior in rank. But he isn't saluting Goeth, he's saluting the officer who has just stepped into the room behind him. SCHERNER Sit down. The colonel sits back down. Scherner pulls up a chair next to Goeth. SCHERNER Hello, Amon. GOETH Sir. Scherner smiles and allows Goeth to shake his hand, but it's clear, even to Goeth himself, that he has fallen from grace. INT. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - NIGHT A tall, thin, gray Waffen SS officer has a request for the Rosner brothers. SS OFFICER I want to hear "Gloomy Sunday" again. He's drunk, morose; it seems unlikely he'll be on his feet much longer. Indeed, as Henry and Leo Rosner begin the son -- an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man commits suicide for love -- the field officer staggers over to a chair in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into it. SCHERNER We give you Jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar, you should kiss us, not them. Goeth laughs too loud, drawing a weary glance from Scherner. Schindler smiles good-naturedly. He's out, a little worse for wear perhaps, a little more subdued than usual. Taking him away from the others, taking him into his confidence -- GOETH God forbid you ever get a real taste for Jewish skirt. There's no future in it. No future. They don't have a future. And that's not just good old- fashioned Jew-hating talk. It's policy now. THE THIN GRAY SS OFFICER is back in front of the musicians, swaying precariously, a drink in his hand -- SS OFFICER "Gloomy Sunday" again. Again they play the song. Again he staggers across the crowded room to his chair in the corner, paying no attention to the visiting Commandant from Treblinka or anybody else -- TREBLINKA GUY -- We can process at Treblinka, if everything is working? I don't know, maybe two thousand units a day. He shrugs like it's nothing, or with modesty, it's unclear. Goeth is dully impressed; Schindler, only politely so. TREBLINKA GUY Now Auschwitz. Now you're talking. What I got is nothing, it's like a... a machine. Auschwitz, though, now there's a death factory. There, they know how to do it. There, they know what they're doing. AGAIN THE GRAY OFFICER wavering before Henry and Leo. This time they don't wait for him to ask for it -- LEO ROSNER "Gloomy Sunday" As the man stumbles back to his chair, the Rosners not only play the song again, they play with it, and him, this one somber man in the corner staring at them almost gratefully, wrenching from the song all the sentimentality they can, as if they could actually drive him to kill himself. No one else in the room is aware of the exchange going on between them -- this man and this music -- which the brothers play as if it were an invocation. Eventually, though, someone does become aware, if not of the intention, at least of the repetition, and interrupts the spell -- GOETH Enough -- Jesus -- God -- The music falls apart. The brothers find Goeth in the crowd looking at them like, Come on, for Christ's sake play something else. Which they do -- defeated -- some innocuous Von Suppe. Goeth turns back to one of his guests. Glancing back, as they play, to the corner, the Rosners see the gloomy SS officer getting slowly up from his chair. He stands there for a moment, staring at nothing, then slowly makes his way out onto the balcony where he stands in the night air, absolutely still, in silhouette to the Rosners. And, ruining a perfectly good party, he takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head. EXT. D.E.F. - DAY From a distance, Schindler can be seen arguing with an SS officer who's trying to hand him papers, orders of some kind, which the irate industrialist refuses to accept. Here, closer, carrying blankets and bundles, Schindler's workers are marched under heavy guard out of the factory and its annexes and across the fortified yard. His people are being taken. Where, is unclear. Schindler abruptly breaks off the discussion with the SS man, climbs into his car and drives off. EXT. FOREST - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY A creek flowing gently through marshy ground under an umbrella of trees. Leo John and his five year old son, on their knees catching tadpoles, seem unaware of, or at least not distracted by, a ghastly endeavor going on beyond them: Bodies being exhumed out of the earth, out of the mass graves in the forest. The dead lay everywhere, victims of the ghetto massacre, victims of Plaszow. Arriving, Schindler sees Goeth standing up at the tree line. Approaching him, furious, he hesitates. He sees a wheelbarrow trundled by Pfefferberg, a corpse in it. He fears the body is Mila's, but then sees her trundling another barrow, another corpse in it. Goeth calls to Schindler -- GOETH Can you believe this? Goeth shakes his head, dismayed. Schindler joins him and stares at a pyre of bodies built by masked and gagging workers, layer upon layer. GOETH I'm trying to live my life, they come up with this? I got to find every body buried up here? And burn it? It's always something. He glances off. The pyre has reached the height of a man's shoulder. The workers move around it dousing it with gasoline. SCHINDLER You took my workers. GOETH (indignant) They're taking mine. When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow. (pause) Auschwitz. SCHINDLER When? GOETH I don't know. Soon. He sighs at the unfairness of it all, the dissolution of his kingdom. His glance finds his man, Leo John, over at the stream. GOETH This is good. I'm out of business and he's catching tadpoles with his son. Tight on the gleeful boy with a tadpole in his hand. Behind him, smoke from the pyre rises into the sky. INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - NIGHT Schindler, in silhouette against the wall of glass, stares down at his deserted factory, his silent machines, the dark empty spaces. INT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - DAY Light pouring in through the windows. White sheets over the furniture like shrouds over the dead. Schindler's personal things are gone. EXT. POLAND/CZECHOSLOVAKIA BORDER - EVENING Schindler's Mercedes, the backseat piled high with suitcases. A border guard returns his passport to him. The barrier is lifted and he crosses into Czech countryside. INT. SQUARE, BRINNLITZ, CZECHOSLOVAKIA - MORNING A church in the main square of a sleepy hamlet. A priest and his parishioners, including Emilie Schindler, emerging from it, morning Mass over. Some guys outside a bar/café, hanging gout, drinking, notice the elegantly dressed gentleman outside the town's only hotel. They recognize him. They come over. SCHINDLER Hey, how you doing? BRINNLITZ GUY 1 Look at this. Schindler, the clothes, the car, the suitcases, the great difference between their respective stations in life. Somehow their old ne'er-do-well friend has managed to do quite well, and it amazes them. Across the square, Emilie has noticed him; and he, her. But neither makes a move toward the other. Finally she walks away; which Schindler interprets correctly to mean, Yes, check into the hotel. He tips the porter extravagantly and turns back to the guys from the bar. SCHINDLER Let me buy you a drink. INT. BAR - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT Except for the clothes of the working class clientele, the scene is reminiscent of the SS nightclub in Cracow: Schindler, the great entertainer, working his way around the tables making sure everybody's got enough to drink, making sure everybody's happy. A guy at a table with a girl gestures him over. BRINNLITZ GUY 2 Oskar - my friend Lena. SCHINDLER How do you do? (to them both) What can I get you, what're you drinking? BRINNLITZ GUY 2 Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it? SCHINDLER Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good. BRINNLITZ GUY 2 Now you're back. SCHINDLER Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to have a good time. So are you. He gestures to the bartender to refill his friend's and his date's drinks, pats the guy on the shoulder and wanders over to the next table. GIRL Who is he? The guy has to think; not because he doesn't know, but because his old friend Oskar is so many things it's hard to know which description to use. Finally -- BRINNLITZ GUY 2 He's a salesman. INT. HOTEL ROOM - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT A woman asleep in the bed. The girl from the bar. In his robe, at the window, Schindler calmly smokes as he stares out at the NIGHT EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAWN The town, off in the distance, nestled against the mountains. The sun, just coming up. Closer, here, ramshackle structures, a long abandoned factory of some kind. Schindler, in leather riding gear, climbs down off a Moto- Guzzi motorcycle. He slowly wanders around, peers in through broken windows, wanders around some more. Tight on his face, torn between conflicting choices, or realizing there's no choice, or only one choice, and hating it. SCHINDLER Goddamn it. EXT. BALCONY, GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY Schindler and Goeth on the balcony of the villa, drinking. GOETH You want these people. SCHINDLER These people, my people, I want my people. Goeth considers his friend, greatly puzzled. Below them lies the camp, still operating, at least for now, until the shipments can be arranged. GOETH What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam? SCHINDLER It's good business. GOETH Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia -- it doesn't make any sense. SCHINDLER Look -- GOETH You're not telling me something. SCHINDLER It's good for me -- I know them, I'm familiar with them. It's good for you -- you'll be compensated. It's good for the Army. You know what I'm going to make? SCHINDLER Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody's happy. GOETH Yeah, sure. Goeth finds this whole line of reasoning impossible to believe. He's sure Schindler's got something else going on here he's not telling him. GOETH You're probably scamming me somehow. If I'm making a hundred, you got to be making three. Schindler admits it with a shrug. GOETH If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how? SCHINDLER I just told you. GOETH You did, but you didn't. Goeth studies him, searching for the real answer in his face. He can't find it. GOETH Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out. SCHINDLER All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you. What's a person worth to you. Goeth thinks about it in the silence. Then a slow nod to himself. He's going to make some money out of this even if he can't figure it out. He smiles. GOETH What's one worth to you? That's the question. HARD CUT TO: THE KEYS OF A TYPEWRITER slapping a name onto a list -- 184 184 LEVARTOV -- the letters the size of buildings, the sound as loud as gunshots -- TIGHT ON THE FACE OF A MAN -- Rabbi Levartov -- the hinge- maker Goeth tried to kill with a faulty revolver -- THE KEYS HAMMER another name -- PERLMAN -- TIGHT ON TWO ELDERLY FACES -- a man, a woman -- the parents of "Elsa Krause." IN HIS SMALL CLUTTERED PLASZOW OFFICE -- Stern transcribes D.E.F.workers' names from a Reich Labor Office document to the list in his typewriter, Schindler's List. NAME -- A FACE -- NAME -- FACE -- NAME -- TIGHT ON SCHINDLER slowly pacing the six or seven steps Stern's cramped office allows, nursing a drink. SCHINDLER Poldek Pfefferberg... Mila Pfefferberg... THE KEYS typing ‘PFEFFE- PFEFFERBERG'S face, tight. MILA'S face, tight. CURRENCY, hard Reichmarks, in a small valise. As Goeth looks at it, he mumbles to himself -- GOETH A virus... MOVING DOWN THE LIST of names, forty, fifty. The sound of the keys. Stern pulls the sheet out of the machine, rolls in another, types a name. EQUIPMENT BEING LOADED onto trucks outside Madritsch's Plaszow factory. SCHINDLER You can do the same thing I'm doing. There's nothing stopping you. Madritsch is shaking his head ‘no' to Schindler's appeal to make his own list, to get his workers out. MADRITSCH I've done enough for the Jews. THE KEYS typing another name -- A FACE, a man, A FACE, a woman, A FACE, a child -- COGNAC SPILLING into a glass. The glass coming up to Schindler's mouth, hesitating there. SCHINDLER The investors. A NAME -- A FACE -- one of the original D.E.F. investors. ANOTHER NAME -- ANOTHER FACE -- another of the Jewish investors. SCHINDLER All of them. Szerwitz, his family. STERN GLANCES UP with a look that asks Schindler if he's sure about this one. He is. The keys type SZERWITZ -- TIGHT ON THE FACE of the investor who stole from Schindler, the one he threatened to have killed by the SS, and the faces of his sons -- THREE OR FOUR PAGES of names next to the typewriter. Stern, trying to count them, estimates -- STERN Four hundred, four fifty -- SCHINDLER More. THE TRUNK OF SCHINDLER'S MERCEDES yawning open. He takes a small valise from it and heads for Goeth's villa. THE KEYS typing ROSNER -- TIGHT ON Henry Rosner, the violinist. TIGHT ON his brother, Leo, the accordionist. SCHINDLER AND BOSCH, the other Plaszow industrialist. The same appeal Schindler made to Madritsch; the same answer, ‘no.' MOVING DOWN another page of names. STERN (O.S.) About six hundred -- SCHINDLER (O.S.) More. THE SOUND OF THE KEYS OVER the face of a boy, the "chicken thief." Over THE FACE OF A GIRL, the one who hid in the pit of excrement. Over the FACES we've never seen. STERN (O.S.) Eight hundred, give or take. SCHINDLER (angrily) Give or take what, Stern -- how many -- count them. STERN RUNS HIS FINGER down the pages of names, trying to count them more precisely. BLACKJACK, dealt by GOETH. They're betting diamonds, he and Schindler. A queen falls and Goeth groans his misfortune. THE FACE OF Goeth's maid. GOETH SWEEPS his hold card against the table, is thrown a four, sweeps it again and gets a jack. A NAME we don't recognize is typed. A FACE we don't recognize. INT. STERN'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - NIGHT Schindler leafing through the page of names, counting them, drinking, to the sound of the typewriter. Eventually, quietly to himself -- SCHINDLER That's it. Stern heard him and stops typing, glances over. SCHINDLER You can finish that page. Stern resumes where he left off, but then hesitates again. There's something he doesn't understand. STERN What did Goeth say? You just told him how many you needed? It doesn't sound right. And Schindler doesn't answer. He's avoided telling Stern the details of the deal struck with Goeth, and balks telling him now. Finally awkwardly -- SCHINDLER I'm buying them. I'm paying him. I give him money, he gives me the people. (pause) If you were still working for me I'd expect you to talk me out of it, it's costing me a fortune. Stern had no idea. And has no idea now what to say. Schindler shrugs like it's no big deal, but Stern knows it is. SCHINDLER Give him the list, he'll sign it, he'll get the people ready. I have to go back to Brinnlitz, to take care of things on that end, I'll see you there. Stern is really overcome by what this man is doing. What he can't figure out is why. Silence. And then -- SCHINDLER Finish the page. Stern turns back, does as he's told. Schindler drinks. Nothing but the sound of the typewriter keys. And then nothing at all. The page is done. The rest will die. INT. TOWN COUNCIL HALL - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT Schindler in front of a large assembly, party pin in his lapel, as usual, imposing SS guards on either side of him. SCHINDLER This is my home. He looks out over his audience, the citizens of Brinnlitz, local government officials, many of them appearing bewildered by him or the "situation" that has arisen. SCHINDLER I was born here, my wife was born here, my mother is buried here, this is my home. His estranged wife is there. So are the guys he was drinking with. SCHINDLER Do you really think I'd bring a thousand Jewish criminals into my home? Everyone seems to breathe sighs of relief as if they've been waiting for him to say this, to dispel the disturbing rumors they've heard. SCHINDLER These are skilled munitions workers -- they are essential to the war effort -- The noise begins, his audience's angry reaction. Raising pitch of his own voice -- SCHINDLER -- It is my duty to supervise them -- and it is your duty to allow me -- He barely gets it all out before the protests drown him out. The uproar reaches such a clamoring level there's no point in his continuing. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY Goeth, at his writing desk, endures the bureaucratic tedium of signing memoranda, transport orders, requisitions. He comes to Schindler's list, initials each page and signs the last with no more interest than the others. He hands the whole stack of paperwork to Marcel Goldberg, Personnel Clerk, Executor of Lists, Gangster. INT. OFFICE, ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - PLASZOW - DAY Goldberg has the signature page of the list in a typewriter. He carefully aligns it and types his own name in a space allowed by the bottom margin. EXT. SCHINDLER'S BRINNLITZ FACTORY SITE - DAY At a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler signs his name to Reich Main Office directives, Evacuation Board and Department of Economy form, Armaments contracts. Around him, the new camp is taking shape: Electric fences are going up, watchtowers, barracks; shipments of heavy equipment, huge Hilo machines, are being off-loaded from flatbed train cars; SS engineers stand around frowning at the lay of the land, some drainage problem no doubt. EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY A train full of people destined for Auschwitz pulls away from the platform. As Goldberg gathers his paperwork, a prisoner approaches him. PRISONER Am I on the list? GOLDBERG What list is that? He knows what the prisoner means and the prisoner knows he knows. He means Schindler's List. GOLDBERG The good list? Well, that depends, doesn't it? The prisoner knows that, too, and discreetly turns over to Goldberg a couple of diamonds from the lining of his coat. INT. GOLDBERG'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - NIGHT Names on a notepad, the first few crossed out. Goldberg types the next name onto a page of The List, squeezing it into the upper margin, and crosses that one out on the pad. He rolls the page down, types another name, tires of the exacting task, tears the handwritten page of names from the notepad, crumples it and throws it away. EXT. BRINNLITZ - NIGHT Schindler, on his way back to his hotel after a night of drinking, is jumped by three guys, wrestled to the ground and brutally kicked. As the forms of his attackers move away, he catches a glimpse of one of them -- his "friend" who admired his car when he first arrived back in town. INT. MECHANICS GARAGE - PLASZOW - DAY Pfefferberg, his head under the hood of a German staff car, adjusting the carburetor. Goldberg comes in. GOLDBERG Hey, Poldek, how's it going? (Pfefferberg ignores him) You know about the list? You're on it. PFEFFERBERG Of course I'm on it. GOLDBERG You want to stay on it? What do you got for me? Pfefferberg glances up from his work and studies the blackmailing collaborator for a long moment. PFEFFERBERG What do I got for you? GOLDBERG Takes diamonds to stay on this list. Pfefferberg suddenly attacks him with the wrench in his hand, beating him across the shoulders and head with it. PFEFFERBERG I'll kill you, that's what I got for you. Goldberg goes down, tries to scramble away on his knees, the blows coming down hard on his back. GOLDBERG All right, all right, all right. He makes it outside the garage and runs. EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY A cattle car is coupled to another, the pin dropped into place. On the platform, clerks at folding tables shuffle paper while others mill around with clipboards, calling out names. Thousands of prisoners on the platform, some climbing onto strings of slatted cars on opposing tracks. Some already in them, most standing in lines, changing lines, the end of one virtually indistinguishable from the beginning of another. Paperwork. Lists of names. Pens in hands checking them off. Some bound for Brinnlitz, the rest for Auschwitz, if they can be properly sorted from one another. A boy is allowed to remain in a line with his father; his mother is taken to another line composed of women and girls. This segregation is the only recognizable process going on; the others, if they exist, are apparent only to the clerks and guards, and maybe not even to them. It is chaos. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT A train snakes across the dark landscape. INT. CATTLE CAR - MOVING - NIGHT Stern, wedged into a corner of an impossibly crowded car. This train may be headed for Schindler's hometown, but it is no more comfortable than the others on their way to Auschwitz -- Birkenau. EXT. CROSSING - POLAND - DAY The train idles at a crossing in the middle of nowhere. Moving across the faces peering out from between the slats, it becomes apparent there are only male prisoners aboard. Below, on a dirt road, a lone Polish boy stands watching. Just before an empty train roars past from the other direction obscuring him, his hand comes up and across his neck making the gesture of a throat being slit. EXT. DEPOT - BRINNLITZ - DAY The train pulls into the small quiet Brinnlitz station. The doors are opened and the prisoners begin climbing down. At the far end of the platform, flanked by several SS guards, stands Schindler. To his customary elegant attire he has added a careless accouterment, a Tyrolean hat. EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAY Leading a procession of nine hundred male Jewish "criminals" through the center of town, Schindler ignores the angry taunts and denouncements and the occasional rock hurled by the good citizens of Brinnlitz lining the streets. INT. BRINNLITZ MUNITIONS FACTORY - DAY Under the towering Hilo machines, a meal of soup and bread awaits the workers. As they're sitting down to it, Schindler addresses them -- SCHINDLER You'll be interested to know I received a cable this morning from the Personnel Office, Plaszow. The women have left. They should be arriving here sometime tomorrow. He sees Stern among the workers, smiles almost imperceptibly, turns and walks away. EXT. RURAL POLAND - DAY A train backs slowly along the tracks toward an arched gatehouse. The women inside the cattle cars don't need a sign to tell them where they are, they've seen this place in nightmares. Pillars of dark smoke rise from the stacks into the sky. It's Auschwitz. EXT. AUSCHWITZ - DAY The stunned women climb down from the railcars onto an immense concourse bisecting the already infamous camp. As they're marched across the muddy yard by guards carrying truncheons, Mila Pfefferberg stares at the place. It' so big, like a city, only one in which the inhabitants reside strictly temporarily. To Mila, under her breath -- WOMAN Where are the clerks? So often terrified by the sight of a clerk with a clipboard, it is the absence of clerks which unsettles the woman now, as though there remains no further reason to record their names. Mila's eyes return to the constant smoke rising beyond the birch trees at the settlement's western end. INT. OFFICES - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Schindler comes out of his office and, passing Stern's desk, mumbles -- SCHINDLER They're in Auschwitz. Before Stern can react, Schindler is out the door. EXT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY As he strides across the factory courtyard toward his motorcycle, Schindler is intercepted by some Gestapo men who have just emerged from their car. GESTAPO Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested. SCHINDLER (pause) I'm sorry to hear that. GESTAPO There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk. SCHINDLER I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back. I have to leave. The looks on their faces tell him he's not going anywhere. SCHINDLER All right, okay, let's talk. GESTAPO In Breslau. SCHINDLER Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now. These guys are serious. EXT. AUSCHWITZ - DAY A young silver-haired doctor moves slowly along rows of Schindler's women, considering each with a pleasant smile even as he makes his selections, with tiny gestures, for the death chambers. He pauses in front of one. YOUNG DOCTOR How old are you, Mother? She could lie, and he'd have killed her for it. She could tell the truth, and he'd have her killed for that, too. WOMAN (pause) Sir, a mistake's been made. We're not supposed to be here, we work for Oskar Schindler. We're Schindler Jews. The doctor nods pensively, understandingly, it seems. Then -- YOUNG DOCTOR And who on earth is Oskar Schindler? He glances around hopelessly. One of the SS guards who accompanied the women from Plaszow speaks up -- PLASZOW GUARD He had a factory in Cracow. Enamelware. The doctor nods again as if the information were valuable, as if it meant something to him. It doesn't. YOUNG DOCTOR A potmaker? He smiles to himself and gets on with the "examination," this woman to this line, this other one to that. INT. CELL - SS PRISON, BRESLAU - DAY In a dank cell, in uniform, Amon Goeth waits. Schindler is on his way, hopefully. Maybe he's already here. Schindler will vouch for him. Schindler will straighten this out. INT. SS PRISON, BRESLAU - DAY In a large room, Schindler sits before a panel of twelve sober Bureau V investigators and a judge of the SS court. INVESTIGATOR Everything you say will be held in confidence. You are not under investigation. You are not under investigation. Mr. Goeth is. He is being held on charges of embezzlement and racketeering. You're here at his request to corroborate his denials. Our information onto his financial speculations comes from many sources. On his behalf there is only you. We know you are close friends. We know this is hard for you. But we must ask you -- SCHINDLER He stole our country blind. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY In Schindler's absence, the workers attempt to operate the unfamiliar machines, to figure out the unfamiliar process of manufacturing artillery shells. There's movement, there's noise, the machines are running, but little is being produced. Untersturmfuhrer Jose Liepold, the Commandant of Schindler's new subcamp, moves through the factory conducting an impromptu inspection. He points out to a guard a kid no more nine, sorting casings at a work table, and another boy, ten or eleven, carrying a box. EXT. BARRACKS - AUSCHWITZ - NIGHT Mila and another woman cross back toward their barracks carrying a large heavy pot of broth. Not more than a hundred meters away stand the birch trees and crematoria, the smoke pluming even now, at NIGHT out of the darkness appear "apparitions," skeletal figures which surround the two women, or rather the soup pot between them, dipping little metal cups into it, over and over. Too startled to speak, Mila can only stare. The apparitions clamor around the pot a moment more, than furtively slip back into the same darkness from which they came. Mila and the other woman exchange a glance. The pot is empty. MILA Where's Schindler now? INT. HOSS' HOUSE - AUSCHWITZ - NIGHT In his en, over cognac, Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Hoss considers the documents Schindler has brought: the list, the travel papers, the Evacuation Board authorization. Hoss nods at them, then at Schindler. HOSS You're right, a clerical error has bee made. (pause) Let me offer you this in apology for the inconvenience. I have a shipment coming in tomorrow, I'll cut you three hundred from it. New ones. These are fresh. Schindler seems to think about the offer as he nurses his drink. It's "tempting." HOSS The train comes, we turn it around, it's yours. SCHINDLER I appreciate it. I want these. The ones on the list in Hoss' hand. Silence. Then: HOSS You shouldn't get stuck on names. Why, because you get to know them? Because you begin to see them as human beings? Schindler suddenly has the awful feeling that the women are already dead. Hoss misinterprets the look. HOSS That's right, it creates a lot of paperwork. EXT. CONCOURSE - AUSCHWITZ - DAY A large assembly of women. Guards calling out names from a list. As each woman steps out of line, a guard unceremoniously brushes a swathe of red paint across her clothes. New columns are formed. EXT. TRAIN YARD - AUSCHWITZ - DAY Schindler, standing at the end of the platform stone-faced, watches the women whose names he is "stuck on," whose clothes are slashed with red paint, climbing onto the cattle cars. As the cars fill, a train on another track arrives. The "fresh" ones Schindler turned down. As the gates are closed on the women's cars, the gates of the others are opened and the people spill out. A horrified cry suddenly breaks through the noise of the engines. One of Schindler's women, locked in, has seen her son among those coming down off the train on the opposing track. Another cry erupts, and another, another, as the women spot their children, confiscated from the Brinnlitz factory, brought here. Schindler becomes aware of what's happening and, passing over other children, tries to corral these particular boys, many of whom have noticed their mothers now and are echoing their tortured cries with their own. Schindler manages to gather them together, the fifteen or twenty boys, and, in the middle of the crowded platform, appears to a guard: SCHINDLER These are mine. They're on the list. These are my workers. They should be on the train. He points across to the women's train, then down to the boys. SCHINDLER They're skilled munition workers. They're essential. The guard glances from the frantic gentleman to the anxious brook around him. These are essential workers? GUARD They're boys. SCHINDLER Yes. Schindler is nodding his head, trying to think. The women are shrieking their sons' names. The guard, who heard it all, every excuse imaginable, is just turning away when Schindler thrusts his smallest finger at him. SCHINDLER Their fingers. They polish the insides of shell casings. How else do you expect me to polish the inside of a 45 millimeter shell casing? The guard stares at him dumbly. This he hasn't heard. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAY Like a mirage in the distance they appear -- the women, the children, guards, Schindler, marching across a field toward the factory. At the perimeter of the camp, at the wire, the men watch the approaching procession. It appears to them that the women are covered in blood -- or -- could it be paint? They're walking, they're fine, some are even smiling. Liepold isn't smiling. Neither is Schindler; at least not on the outside. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY The machines are silent, the people are not. Women are in their husbands' arms, sons in their fathers'. There's food on the tables but it's largely ignored, the reunion taking precedence. INT. SS MESS HALL - SAME TIME - DAY Schindler stands before the assembled camp guards. They are seated at the long tables, their food getting cold, waiting for him to say whatever it is he has to say. SCHINDLER Under Department W provisions, it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause. Under the Businesses Compensation Fund I am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths. If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison and I get paid, that's how it works. So there will be no summary executions here. There will be no interference of any kind with production. In hopes of ensuring that, guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my authorization. His eyes meet Liepold's, hold his icy stare, then return to the guards, most of whom look like tired middle-aged reservists. SCHINDLER For your cooperation, you have my gratitude. As he steps away he gestures to some kitchen workers. They tear open cases of schnapps and begin setting the bottles out on the tables. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Schindler strolls through his factory looking over the shoulders of the workers, nodding his approval. The place is in full operation, finally; the people, having figured out the complicated Hilos, turning out shells by the caseload. Schindler pauses at one of the machines. SCHINDLER How's it going? WORKER Good. It's taken a while to calibrate the machines, but it's going good now. SCHINDLER Good. Schindler nods. Then frowns. He leans down and taps at the crystal of one of the gauges. SCHINDLER This isn't right, is it? The worker kneels down, takes a look. It looks right to him. Reaching over, Schindler changes the calibration of the machine with a cavalier adjustment to a knob -- and all the gauge readings shift. SCHINDLER There. That looks right. He wanders off. The worker stares after him. He's just screwed up settings that took weeks to get right. Schindler comes up to another worker, Levartov, the hingemaker. He's at a machine buffing shells. SCHINDLER How's it going, Rabbi? LEVARTOV Good, sir. Schindler nods, watches him work, eventually glances away. SCHINDLER Sun's going down. Levartov, following Schindler's gaze, nods uncertainly. SCHINDLER It is Friday, isn't it? LEVARTOV Is it? SCHINDLER You should be preparing for the Sabbath, shouldn't you? What are you doing here? Levartov just stares. It's been years since he's been allowed, indeed inclined, to perform Sabbath rites. SCHINDLER I've got some wine in my office. Why don't we go over there, I'll give it to you. Come on, let's go. Schindler heads off. The rabbi keeps staring. Schindler gestures back to him, offering casually -- SCHINDLER Come on. Levartov looks around. Finally, he hangs up his goggles and follows after Schindler. INT. WORKERS BARRACKS - NIGHT Under the shadow of a watchtower, among the roof-high tiers of bunks strung with laundry, Levartov recites Kiddush over a cup of wine to workers gathered around him. INT. GUARDS BARRACKS - NIGHT On their bunks, the guards relax with schnapps, cards and magazines. One of them becomes distracted by a distant sound. Some of the others begin to hear it. GUARD What is that? Conversations cease. The barracks gradually becomes quiet, silent, all the guards straining to hear. It sounds like... singing. It sounds like Yiddish singing. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - SAME TIME - NIGHT On a watchtower, a night sentry, unsure where it's coming from, listens to the distant singing. It seems like it's emanating from the surrounding hills, from the trees. INT. LIEPOLD'S QUARTERS - SAME TIME - NIGHT At his small desk, Liepold is typing a letter, denouncing Schindler most likely. The pounding keys bury all other sounds but when he pauses to reread what he's typed, he hears it, the singing, faint, far away. He goes to his window, peers out, listens for a moment more, then hears nothing. Only the night creatures. INT. APATMENT BUILDING - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT The door to an apartment opens from the inside revealing Emilie Schindler. She coolly considers the visitor on her doorstep, her estranged husband, looking great as usual, bottle of wine in his hand, smiling as if nothing is wrong between them, as if nothing is wrong in the entire world. INT. EMILIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The two of them at the kitchen table in a modest apartment, drinking, at least he is. He's trying to ask her something, but he's not sure how to put it, he wants to get it right. Finally the words just tumble out -- SCHINDLER I want you to come work for me. There, he's said it. But the bewildered look on Emilie's face wonders, That's what was hard for you to say? SCHINDLER You don't have to live with me, I wouldn't ask that. (pause) It's a nice place. You'd like it. It looks awful. You get used to that. She's the only woman he's even known who could make him nervous just sitting across a table from him, saying nothing. SCHINDLER All right -- (now he'll be honest) We can spend time together that way. We can see each other, see how it goes -- without the strain of -- whatever you want to call it when a man, a husband and a wife go out to dinner, go have a drink, go to a party, you know. This way we'll see each other at work, there we are, same place, we see how it goes... His voice trails off. A shrug adds, What do you think? She doesn't answer, but she does love him. He loves her, too. It really is a shame they're not right for each other and never will be. INT. OFFICES - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Stern glances up from his work; Schindler and Emilie have come in and are walking toward the accountant's desk. He gets up. SCHINDLER Itzhak Stern, Emilie Schindler. My wife. Like the doormen and waiters of Cracow, Stern too never imagined Schindler was married and has trouble hiding his astonishment now. He extends his hand to her. STERN How do you do? EMILIE How do you do? STERN Stern is my accountant and friend. It sounds strange to Stern hearing Schindler actually say it. He's never said it before. SCHINDLER Emilie's offered to work in the clinic. To... work there. He's not sure what she's going to do there, she's not a nurse or a doctor. STERN (to her) That's very generous of you. SCHINDLER Yes. Schindler nods, looks around, shrugs, offers his arm to his wife, perhaps to take her on a tour of the place. STERN It was a pleasure meeting you. EMILIE Pleasure meeting you. The Schindlers leave. Stern sits back down at his desk and smiles. He's never seen Schindler so uncomfortable. INT. MACHINE SHOP - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Schindler comes in carrying a radio. He sets it down on a bench where Pfefferberg's working on the frame of a machine motor with a blow torch. SCHINDLER Can you fix it? The radio. PFEFFERBERG What's wrong with it? SCHINDLER How should I know? It's broken. See what you can do. He leaves. Pfefferberg plugs it into an outlet and switches it on. It works perfectly. A waltz. INT. BARRACKS - BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT In a male barracks, a group of workers including Pfefferberg huddle in a corner around the radio, straining to hear through heavy static a broadcast by the BBC, the Voice of London, a sketchy report of an Eastern offensive by Allied Russian forces. INT. CLINIC - BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAY As a camp doctor attends to sufferers of dysentery, Schindler and Emilie sort pairs of prescription glasses from a parcel, shipped from Cracow. Stern comes in. STERN We need to talk. SCHINDLER Stern. Schindler sifts through the glasses still in the box, comes up with a particular pair and holds them proudly. Not quite sure what he's seeing is real -- STERN They arrived. SCHINDLER They arrived, can you believe it? Stern allows himself a smile, a rare thing for him. Schindler carefully slips the new glasses onto the accountant's face. He looks around the clinic, Stern, eventually settling on Emilie, crystal clear, standing near a picture on the wall which, in other circumstances, he'd find less than reassuring: Jesus, his heart exposed and in flames. INT. CLINIC - LATER - DAY In a quiet corner of the clinic, Schindler concentrates on the disquieting news Stern has brought him: STERN We've received a complaint from the Armaments Board. A very angry complaint. The artillery shells, the tank shells, rocket casings -- apparently all of them -- have failed quality-control tests. Schindler nods soberly. Then dismisses the problem with a shrug. SCHINDLER Well, that's to be expected. They have to understand. These are start- up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business. I'll write them a letter. STERN They're withholding payment. SCHINDLER Well, sure. So would I. So would you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll get it right one of these days. But Stern is worried about it. STERN There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines. (Schindler doesn't deny it) I don't think that's a good idea. SCHINDLER (pause) No? Stern slowly shakes his head 'no.' STERN They could close us down. Schindler eventually nods, in agreement it seems. SCHINDLER All right. Call around, find out where we can buy shells and buy them. We'll pass them off as ours. Stern's not sure he sees the logic. Whether the shells are manufactured here or elsewhere, they'll still eventually reach their intended destination, into the hearts and heads of Germany's enemies. STERN I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference. SCHINDLER You don't? I do. I see a difference. STERN You'll lose money. That's one difference. SCHINDLER Fewer shells will be made. That's another difference. The main one. The only one Schindler cares about. Silence. Then: SCHINDLER Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired... I'll be very unhappy. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY A nineteen year old boy with his hands in the air stands terrified before Commandant Liepold and the revolver he wields. Workers, trying to reduce the likelihood of getting hit by a stray bullet when Liepold fires on the boy -- which seems a certainty -- scramble out of the way. SCHINDLER (O.S.) Hey. Liepold swings the gun around at the voice, pointing it for a moment at Schindler, who is striding toward him, then aims the barrel back at the boy's head, and yells -- LIEPOLD Department W does not forbid my presence on the factory floor. That is a lie. He waves a document at Schindler, throws it at him. Schindler doesn't bother picking it up. Instead, pointing at the boy, he yells to Liepold -- SCHINDLER Shoot him. Shoot him! Liepold is so startled by the command, he doesn't shoot. He doesn't lower the gun, though, either. SCHINDLER Shoot him without a hearing. Come on. His finger is on the trigger, Liepold is torn, frustrated, hating the situation he has created. As the moments without a blast stretch out, both and Schindler begin to settle down. LIEPOLD He sabotaged the machine. Schindler glances to the boy. Then at the silent Hilo beside him. Part of it is blackened from an electrical fire. To the boy, concerned -- SCHINDLER The machine's broken? The boy, too terrified to speak, nods. LIEPOLD The prisoner is under the jurisdiction of Section D. I'll preside over the hearing. SCHINDLER But the machine. Liepold glances to him. He seems almost distraught by the destruction of the machine, Schindler. SCHINDLER The machine is under the authorization of the Armaments Inspectorate. I will preside over the hearing. Liepold isn't sure that's correct, but he has no documentation, at least not on him, to refute it. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT In the machine-tool section, a "judicial table" has been set up. At it sit Schindler, Liepold, two other SS officers, and an attractive German girl, a stenographer. The "saboteur," the boy, Janek, stands before the court. JANEK I'm unfamiliar with the Hilo machines. I don't know why I was assigned there. Commandant Liepold was watching me trying to figure it out. I switched it on and it blew up. I didn't do anything. All I did was turn it on. Gone tonight is Schindler's usual shop-floor familiarity. He studies the boy solemn-faced. SCHINDLER If you're not skilled at armaments work, you shouldn't be here. JANEK I'm a lathe operator. Schindler dismisses the defensive comment with a wave of his hand and gets up. He comes around and paces slowly before the boy. Eventually, Janek dares to speak again -- JANEK Sir? Schindler glances up at him distractedly. JANEK I did adjust the pressure controls. Schindler stops, looks to the panel, and back to the boy. SCHINDLER What? JANEK I know that much about them. Somebody had set the pressure controls wrong. I had to adjust -- Schindler slams the back of his hand so hard across Janek's face, the boy almost falls. He's stunned. So are the others at the table. They've never seen such violence from the Direktor. He roars -- SCHINDLER The stupidity of these people. I wish they were capable of sabotaging a machine. Schindler's hand comes up again and Janek recoils, expecting another blow. Schindler manages to hold it. SCHINDLER Get him out of my sight. A guard escorts the prisoner away. The panel members glance among themselves. Is that it? Schindler faces them and groans in dismay. INT. LIEPOLD'S QUARTERS - NIGHT Liepold at his desk, typing again. This time there is no doubt he is composing a letter denouncing Schindler. INT. HOUSE - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT Schindler and Emilie, her arm in his, stand around like unwanted guests at the party. They probably are. Him anyway. The other guests include local politicians who fought and failed to keep his camp out of Brinnlitz. Whenever his glance meets one of theirs, they smile tightly. SCHINDLER (to Emilie) Isn't this nice. It's not at all nice. He feels out of place, a feeling he's not accustomed to. Fortunately, a man in uniform, someone Schindler can relate to, approaches cheerfully, his hand outstretched. RASCH Oskar, good of you to come. SCHINDLER Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie. RASCH How do you do? EMILIE You have a lovely home. It is nice. Big. The man lives well. RASCH Thank you. SCHINDLER I need a drink. RASCH Oh, God, you don't have a drink? SCHINDLER (to Emilie) Wine? She nods. Schindler goes off in search of the bartender. Rasch watches after him. RASCH Your husband's a very generous man. EMILIE (wry) He's always been. INT. RASCH'S STUDY - LATER - NIGHT Rasch and Schindler sharing cognac in the privacy of the Police Chief's study. Beyond the closed doors, the party continues, the sounds filtering in. SCHINDLER I need guns. Rasch calmly nurses his drink, his eyes revealing nothing of what's going on behind them, except that the statement requires some elaboration. SCHINDLER One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate. I'd like the chance to defend myself. I'd like my wife to have that chance. My civilian engineers. My secretary. RASCH (pause; then, philosophically) We're losing the war, aren't we. SCHINDLER It kind of looks that way. RASCH (blithely) Pistols? SCHINDLER Pistols, rifles, carbines ... (long pause) I'd be grateful. Rasch smiles faintly. Yes, he's familiar, as are officials throughout much of Europe, with the gratitude of Oskar Schindler. INT. MACHINE SHOP - BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT Poldek Pfefferberg holds up a pistol, feels its weight, points it. SCHINDLER (calmly) Careful. Pfefferberg smiles, lowers the gun, kneels beside an open crate of weapons: a couple of revolvers and rifles, an old carbine. INT. FACTORY - DAY From high above the factory, Stern can be seen among the machines talking with a worker. The man points up and returns to his work. Stern stares up, puzzled. He locates a ladder that connects the shop-floor to a series of overhead planks and, with trepidation, climbs. He reaches a shaky landing high above the machines, navigates the primitive catwalks with great care, comes to a large water tank near the workshop ceiling. SCHINDLER Stern. Above the rim of the tank, amid rising steam, Schindler's head appears. Then disappears. Stern climbs a set of rungs on the tank, reaches the top and finds inside, lolling in the steaming water, Schindler and the blonde stenographer from the trial. STERN Excuse me. Neither Schindler nor the blonde seems the least bit embarrassed. Only Stern. He tries hard to pretend the girl isn't there, but he just can't. STERN I'll talk to you later. SCHINDLER No, no, what, what is it? Schindler floats over closer to him, waits for him to report whatever it is he has come to report, leans closer. Finally, quietly -- STERN Do you have any money I don't know about? Hidden away someplace? Schindler thinks long and hard... SCHINDLER No. Silence except for the gently lapping water. Half-joking -- SCHINDLER Why, am I broke? Stern glances away, doesn't answer, just stares off. And a slight, slight smile, a gambler's philosophical smile upon being purged of his wealth, appears on Schindler's face. EXT. RURAL BRINNLITZ - DAY In the distance, a lone boxcar, stark against the winter landscape. There are patches of snow on the ground. A cold wind blows through bare trees. SCHINDLER (V.O.) Poldek. INT. MACHINE SHOP - BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAY Tight on Poldek Pfefferberg's eyes behind a welder's mask. He turns from his work to the voice, welding torch in his hand. EXT. RURAL BRINNLITZ - DAY The torch firing at ice as hard as metal, blue flame, white steam. Pfefferberg's eyes behind the mask again, concentrating. Around the abandoned boxcar, in the gruesome cold, stand Schindler, Emilie, a doctor, some workers and some SS guards, watching, waiting. Pfefferberg steps back. Sledge hammers pound at locks. Hands pull at levers. The doors begin to slide. Out of darkness, from inside the boxcar as the doors slide open, Schindler's face is revealed, tight. He stares for an interminable moment before walking slowly away. Inside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs, a pyramid of corpses, frozen white. From a distance, a tableau: the boxcar, the workers and guards and Emilie outside it, Schindler, off to himself several steps away, all of them still as statues. EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - OUTSIDE BRINNLITZ - DAY Beyond a country church, among the stone markers of a small cemetery, walk Schindler and a priest. SCHINDLER It's been suggested I cremate them in my furnaces. As a Catholic I will not. As a human being I will not. The priest nods; he seems relatively empathic. He offers an alternative -- PRIEST There's an area beyond the church reserved for the burial of suicides. Maybe I can convince the parish council to allow them to be buried there. SCHINDLER These aren't suicides. The priest knows that. But he also knows that the provisions of Canon Law regarding who can and cannot be buried in consecrated ground are narrow. SCHINDLER These are victims of a great murder. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY In a corner of the factory, workers hammer at pine lumber. They are building coffins. EXT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY As workers harness horses to carts, others hoist the coffins into them. Schindler is there, watching. He glances up at one of the guard towers, expecting, perhaps, to be felled by a bullet. EXT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Beyond the wire, Rabbi Levartov leads the horse-drawn carts. Around him walk a minyan -- a quorum of ten males necessary for the rite. A few guards lag behind. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - SAME TIME - DAY Work continues, but it's apparent in their eyes they are only physically here; in spirit they are all walking alongside the carts, one great moral force. The roar of a machine suddenly, inexplicably, dies. Then another. And another. Schindler, standing at the main power panel, pulls the last of the switches, and the factory plunges into absolute silence. EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY Just beyond the perimeter of the Catholic cemetery, the minyan quickly and quietly recites Kaddish over the dead as their coffins are lowered into individual graves. Then, there is only a low breathing of wind. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - ANOTHER DAY Amon Goeth, in civilian clothes, emerges from a car. His eyes, sallow from inadequate sleep, sweep across the fortified compound with envy. It's a nice place Oskar's got here. INT. OFFICE - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - SAME TIME - DAY Stern, at a window, stares down at Goeth beside his car. Softly, gravely -- STERN What's he doing here? Schindler appears beside Stern, glances down. He's lost weight, Goeth. The old suit he wears seems too big for him. Alone down there he seems disoriented. SCHINDLER Probably looking for a handout. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Workers glance up at a horrible apparition from the pit of their foulest dreams -- Amon Goeth crossing through the factory. Schindler, his arm around the killer's shoulder as if he were a long lost brother, leads him across the shop-floor, proudly pointing out to him the huge thundering Hilo machines. INT. OFFICES, BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Schindler takes an old suitcase from his office closet, sets it on his desk, snaps it open revealing clothes, Goeth's uniforms, his medals. The ex-Oberstrumfuhrer touches the fabric gently, then glances up gratefully to his friend. GOETH Thank you. INT. OUTER OFFICES - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Beyond the frosted glass of Schindler's office door, Stern can see the wavering forms of the two Nazi Party members sharing cognac and stories. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY Warmed by cognac and friendship, Goeth comes through the factory again carrying the suitcase, Schindler at his side, steering him to some degree. Goeth's hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away a bothersome fly. But it isn't a fly. One of the workers has spit on him. He turns in disbelief. Silence as his hand drops to his side, to the holster he forgets isn't there. He glances around for SS guards... who aren't there. He looks to Schindler, thoroughly confused, and whispers -- GOETH Where are the guards? SCHINDLER The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous. Goeth stares at him bewildered. Then again at the worker who spit. Then at other workers, the resolve in their eyes. They know he has no power here, and sense he has no power anywhere. His own eyes drift to a woman with yarn in her lap, knitting needles in her hands. Is this a dream? SCHINDLER I'll discipline him later. Schindler good-naturedly throws an arm around Goeth's shoulder and leads him away. The workers watch as the two Germans disappear out the factory doors. INT. GUARDS' BARRACKS - EVENING A guard slowly turns the dial of a radio, finding and losing in static several different voices in several languages, none of them lasting more than a moment. Depression hangs over the barracks. Most of the guards are straining to hear the news they've been fearing for some time now, some on their bunks just staring, one at a window peering out at the black face of a forest as if expecting, at any moment, to see Russian or American troops appear. INT. WORKER'S BARRACKS - SAME TIME - EVENING Another radio. Workers, like the guards, straining to hear. The dial finds, faint, mired in static, the idiosyncratic voice of Winston Churchill. INT. LIEPOLD'S QUARTERS - SAME TIME - EVENING Schindler on Liepold's doorstep. The two men considering each other across the threshold. Radio static filters out from Liepold's room. The word "Eisenhower" cuts through before the speaker's voice is buried again. SCHINDLER It's time the guards came into the factory. He turns and walks away. INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - NIGHT All twelve hundred workers and all the guards are gathered for the first time on the factory floor. Tension and uncertainty surround them. It's ominously quiet. Then -- SCHINDLER The unconditional surrender of Germany has just been announced. At midnight tonight the war is over. It is not his intention to elicit celebration. Indeed, his words, echoing and fading in the factory, echo the doubts they all feel. SCHINDLER Tomorrow, you'll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families. In many cases you won't find them. After six long years of murder, victims are being mourned throughout the world. Not by Untersturmfuhrer Liepold. He stands with his men, dying to lift his rifle and fire. SCHINDLER We've survived. Some of you have come up to me and thanked me. Thank yourselves. Thank your fearless Stern, and others among you, who, worrying about you, have faced death every moment. (glancing away) Thank you. He's looking at the guards, thanking them, which thoroughly confuses the workers. Just when they thought they knew where his sentiments lay, he's thanking guards. SCHINDLER You've shown extraordinary discipline. You've behaved humanely here. You should be proud. Or is he attempting to adjust reality, to destroy the SS as combatants, to alter the self-image of both the guards and the prisoners? Moving across the SS men's faces, they remain inscrutable. Schindler turns his attention back to the workers, and, not at all like a confession, but rather like simple statements of fact: SCHINDLER I'm a member of the Nazi party. I'm a munitions manufacturer. I'm a profiteer of slave labor, I'm a criminal. At midnight, you will be free and I will be hunted. (pause) I'll remain with you until five minutes after midnight After which time, and I hope you'll forgive me, I have to flee. That worries the workers. Whenever he leaves, something terrible always seems to happen. SCHINDLER In memory of the countless victims among your people, I ask us to observe three minutes of silence. In the quiet, in the silence, drifting slowly across the faces of the workers -- the elderly, the lame, teenagers, wives beside husbands, children beside their parents, families together -- it becomes clear, if it wasn't before, that both as a prison and a manufacturing enterprise, the Brinnlitz camp has been one long sustained confidence game. Schindler has never stood still so long in his life. He does now, though, framed by his giant Hilo machines, silent at the close of the noisiest of wars, his head bowed, mourning the many dead. When he finally does look up he sees that he is the last to do so. The faces, few of which he recognizes, are all looking at him. He turns to speak to the guards along the wall again. SCHINDLER I know you've received orders from our Commandant -- which he has received from his superiors -- to dispose of the population of this camp. Apprehension spreads across the factory like a wave. Pfefferberg tightens his grip on the pistol under his coat. His ragtag irregulars do the same, the rest of their ersatz "arsenal" concealed behind a machine. To the guards: SCHINDLER Now would be the time to do it. They're all here. This is your opportunity. The guards hold their weapons, as they have from the moment they arrived here tonight, at attention, waiting it seems, to be given the official order from their Commander, Liepold, who appears ready to give it. SCHINDLER Or... (he shrugs) ...you could leave. And return to your families as men instead of murderers. Long, long silence. Finally, one of the guards slowly lowers his rifle, breaks ranks and walks away. Then another. And another. And another. Another. When the last is gone, the workers consider Liepold. He appears more an oddity than a threat. He is more an oddity than a threat. And he knows it. He turns and leaves. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT A watchtower. Abandoned. The perimeter wire. No sentries. The guard barracks. Deserted. The SS is long gone. EXT. COURTYARD - BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT Schindler and Emilie emerge from his quarters, each carrying a small suitcase. In the dark, some distance away from his Mercedes, stand all twelve hundred workers. As Schindler and his wife cross the courtyard to the car, Stern and Levartov approach. The rabbi hands him some papers. LEVARTOV We've written a letter trying to explain things. In case you're captured. Every worker has signed it. Schindler sees a list of signatures beginning below the typewritten text and continuing for several pages. He pockets it, this new list of names. SCHINDLER Thank you. Stern steps forward and places a ring in Schindler's hand. It's a gold band, like a wedding ring. Schindler notices an inscription inside it. STERN It's Hebrew. It says, 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world.' Schindler slips the ring onto a finger, admires it a moment, nods his thanks, then seems to withdraw. SCHINDLER (to himself) I could've got more out... Stern isn't sure he heard right. Schindler steps away from him, from his wife, from the car, from the workers. SCHINDLER (to himself) I could've got more... if I'd just... I don't know, if I'd just... I could've got more... STERN Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you. Look at them. He can't. SCHINDLER If I'd made more money... I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just... STERN There will be generations because of what you did. SCHINDLER I didn't do enough. STERN You did so much. Schindler starts to lose it, the tears coming. Stern, too. The look on Schindler's face as his eyes sweep across the faces of the workers is one of apology, begging them to forgive him for not doing more. SCHINDLER This car. Goeth would've bought this car. Why did I keep the car? Ten people, right there, ten more I could've got. (looking around) This pin -- He rips the elaborate Hakenkreus, the swastika, from his lapel and holds it out to Stern pathetically. SCHINDLER Two people. This is gold. Two more people. He would've given me two for it. At least one. He would've given me one. One more. One more person. A person, Stern. For this. One more. I could've gotten one more person I didn't. He completely breaks down, weeping convulsively, the emotion he's been holding in for years spilling out, the guilt consuming him. SCHINDLER They killed so many people... (Stern, weeping too, embraces him) They killed so many people... From above, from a watchtower, Stern can be seen down below, trying to comfort Schindler. Eventually, they separate, and Schindler and Emilie climb into the Mercedes. It slowly pulls out through the gates of the camp. And drives away. EXT. BRINNLITZ - NIGHT A panzer emerges from the treeline well beyond the wire of the camp and just sits there growling like a beast. Suddenly it fires a shell at nothing in particular, at the night -- an exhibition of random spite -- then turns around and rolls back into the forest. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - SAME TIME - NIGHT From a watchtower, a couple of workers, having witnessed the tank's display of impotent might, can make little sense of it. Below, many of the workers mill around the yard, waiting to be liberated. No one seems to know what else to do. EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAY Some Czech partisans emerge from the forest. They come down the hill and casually approach the camp. Reaching the wire, they're met by Pfefferberg and some other workers, rifles slung over their shoulders. Through the fence -- PARTISAN It's all over. PFEFFERBERG We know. PARTISAN (pause) So what are you doing? You're free to go home. PFEFFERBERG When the Russians arrive. Until then we're staying here. The partisan shrugs, Suit yourself, and wanders back toward the trees with his friends. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT Five headlights appear out of the night, five motorcycles marked with the SS Death's-head insignia. They turn onto the road leading to the camp gate and park, the riders shutting off the engines. SS NCO Hello? Shapes materialize out of the darkness within the camp. Several armed and dangerous Jews. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - LATER - NIGHT As the cyclists fill their tanks with gasoline borrowed from the camp, the workers keep their rifles pointed at them. The NCO in charge lines the gas cans neatly back up against the wire. NCO IN CHARGE Thank you very much. He climbs onto his motorcycle. The others climb onto theirs. And drive away. EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAWN A lone Russian officer on horseback, tattered coat, rope for reins, emerges from the forest. As he draws nearer, it becomes apparent to the workers assembling on the camp yard, that the horse is a mere pony, the Russian's feet in stirrups nearly touching the ground beneath the animal's skinny abdomen. He reaches the camp, climbs easily down from the horse and, in a loud voice, addresses the hundreds of workers standing at the fence: RUSSIAN You have been liberated by the Soviet Army. This is it? This one man? The workers wait for him to say more. He waits for them to move, to leave, to go home. Finally -- RUSSIAN What's wrong? A few of the workers come out from behind the fence to talk with him. WORKER Have you been in Poland? RUSSIAN I just came from Poland. WORKER Are there any Jews left? The Russian has to think. Eventually he shrugs, 'no,' not that he saw, and climbs back onto his pony to leave. WORKER Where should we go? RUSSIAN I don't know. Don't go east, that's for sure, they hate you there. (pause) I wouldn't go west either if I were you. He shrugs and gives his little horse a kick in the ribs. WORKER We could use some food. The Russian looks confused, glances off. The quiet hamlet of Brinnlitz sits there against the mountains not half a mile away. RUSSIAN Isn't that a town over there? Of course it is. But the idea that they could simply walk over there is completely foreign to them. The Russian rides away. EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAY All twelve hundred of them, a great moving crowd coming forward, crosses the land laying between the camp, behind them, and the town, in front of them. Tight on the FACE of one of the MEN. Tight on TYPEWRITER KEYS rapping his NAME. Tight on A PEN scratching out the words, "METAL POLISHER" on a form. Tight on the KEYS typing, "TEACHER." Tight on his FACE in the crowd. Tight on the face of a woman in the moving crowd. The keys typing her name. The pen scratching out "LATHE OPERATOR." The keys typing "PHYSICIAN." Tight on her face. Tight on a man's face. His name. Pen scratching out "ELECTRICIAN." Keys typing "MUSICIAN." His face. A woman's face. Name. Pen scratching out "MACHINIST." Keys typing "MERCHANT." Face. "CARPENTER." Face. "SECRETARY." Face. "DRAFTSMAN." Face. "PAINTER." Face. "JOURNALIST." Face. "NURSE." Face. "JUDGE." Face. Face. Face. Face. HARD CUT TO: EXT. FRANKFURT - DUSK (1955) A street of apartment buildings in a working class neighborhood of the city. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK The door to a modest apartment opens revealing Oskar Schindler. The elegant clothes are gone but the familiar smile remains. SCHINDLER Hey, how you doing? It's Poldek Pfefferberg out in the hall. PFEFFERBERG Good. How's it going? SCHINDLER Things are great, things are great. Things don't look so great. Schindler isn't penniless, but he's not far from it, living alone in the one room behind him. PFEFFERBERG What are you doing? SCHINDLER I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink. PFEFFERBERG I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while. SCHINDLER (puzzled) I've been here. I guess I haven't been out. PFEFFERBERG I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over. SCHINDLER Yeah? Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat. Pfefferberg waits out in the hall as Schindler disappears inside for a minute. The legend below appears: AMON GOETH WAS ARRESTED AGAIN, WHILE A PATIENT IN AN SANITARIUM AT BAD TOLZ. GIVING THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST SALUTE, HE WAS HANGED IN CRACOW FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. Schindler reappears wearing a coat, steps out into the hall, forgets something, turns around and goes back in. OSKAR SCHINDLER FAILED AT SEVERAL BUSINESSES, AND MARRIAGE, AFTER THE WAR IN 1958, HE WAS DECLARED A RIGHTEOUS PERSON BY THE COUNCIL OF THE YAD VASHEM IN JERUSALEM, AND INVITED TO PLANT A TREE IN THE AVENUE OF THE RIGHTEOUS. IT GROWS THERE STILL. He comes back out with a nice bottle of wine in his hand, and, as he and Pfefferberg disappear down the stairs together -- SCHINDLER'S VOICE Mila's good? PFEFFERBERG'S VOICE She's good. SCHINDLER'S VOICE Kids are good? Let's stop at a store on the way so I can buy them something. PFEFFERBERG'S VOICE They don't need anything. They just want to see you. SCHINDLER'S VOICE Yeah, I know. I'd like to pick up something for them. It'll only take a minute. Their voices face. Against the empty hallway appears a faint trace of the image of the factory workers, through the wire, walking away from the Brinnlitz camp. And the legend: THERE ARE FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND JEWS LEFT ALIVE IN POLAND TODAY. THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND DESCENDANTS OF THE SCHINDLER JEWS. THE END
